\chapter{}
Wednesday morning, I was excited. Today was going to be a great adventure. Monique was off
work today, so the plan was going to be to cast Samantha in two plaster long leg casts, and then
put a purple short arm cast on Monique. We would then go about 50 miles north into Indiana, and
photograph Monique pushing Sam around in the wheelchair. This would be my first time with two
models casted at the same time, and it looked to be fun.

Ten minutes before ten o'clock, there was a knock at the door. I was in the casting room,
making sure everything was laid out and ready, so Monique went to get the door.

Less than a minute later, I heard Monique call out. ``Quinn, come here, please.'' There was
something in her voice that I did not like. She sounded scared.

I went to the door, and Monique stood there, as did Samantha. With them was a middle aged
man. Everyone looked serious. I noticed that Samantha and the man both had pistols in holsters
on their belts.

``Mr. Quinn,'' the man started, ``I'm detective Tom Johnson. This is detective Cassidy Smith.''
He motioned toward the woman whom I knew up until now as Samantha.

I was taken aback. I knew I hadn't done anything against the law, but I had a serious
concern that THEY might not know that. I glanced toward Monique, who looked both confused and
scared.

``Is there some sort of problem?'' I asked, trying not to sound nervous.

``Actually, no.'' Johnson said.

Samantha (or whatever her name was) interrupted him. ``Quinn, there was a guy who'd been
assaulting women on college campuses around here. He put ads in college newspapers for models,
and when the women would come to interview, he would drug them and rape them. We saw your ad,
and thought you might be the one.''

Now, I was a bit irritated. I knew I had no reason to be- they were just doing their job-
but I always made sure to treat my models with the utmost in respect.

``Are you satisfied now that I'm no rapist?'' I asked, trying to conceal my indignation.

``Yes, we are.'' Johnson said. The guy got caught in Lexington last week. He confessed.
You're in the clear.''

``You didn't do anything wrong when I was here,'' Samantha said. ``But if you're going to
continue doing what you're doing, you need to be very careful.'' She had turned to look at
Monique, even though she was still talking to me. ``What you're doing here comes very close to a
thin line. And we now know who and where you are. Be very careful not to cross that line.''

Now, I was pissed. She didn't know about my relationship with Monique. She was assuming
that Monique was just another model, and was either fishing for something to use against me, or
trying to intimidate me. Probably both.

Monique spoke up. ``He has never been inappropriate with me, either.''

``That's good,'' Johnson said. He reached into his pocket and pulled out two business cards.
He handed one each to Monique and myself. ``Here's my card. If you have any questions, you can
give me a call. Otherwise, we'll hopefully not talk again.'' Samantha handed a copy of her card
to each of us without adding anything. They turned, and walked out the door.

Monique turned to me. ``That was interesting.''

``That was bullshit.'' I replied. ``Did you catch the attempt to intimidate us?''

``I noticed it, yes.''

``I understand them checking me out.'' I said. ``I understand that it's their job. What pisses
me off is the way they tried to scare me with the 'We know who and where you are' crap.''

Monique tried to break my bad mood. ``Well, I lied a bit. I told them you'd never done
anything inappropriate.'' She put her arms around me. ``You've done wonderfully inappropriate
things with me.'' She said with a smile.

I couldn't help but smile back at her. She kissed me. It amazed me how quickly she could
turn my bad mood 180 degrees.

She abruptly broke the embrace. ``Wait a second! I just thought of something. Now I am angry
at them!''

``Why is that?''

``I had a date with a handsome man and some fiberglass.'' She said with mock anger. ``They
just ruined my day. Do you suppose we could find a way to rectify that?''

``Do you still want to?'' I asked her.

``Yes, if I can have more than just a short arm cast. They're better than nothing, but kind
of boring.''

I took a mock serious tone. ``Ma'am, you can have anything you'd like. I place myself at
your service.''

She turned and took a step toward the casting room. She stopped, looked over her left
shoulder at me, and used a finger to motion me to follow.

In the cast room, she went to the cart on which we'd laid out the supplies. She gathered up
the plaster rolls, and put them back in the cabinet. She then took out two boxes of five inch
fiberglass and set them next to the box of three inch that was already laid out.

``I was supposed to be your assistant today. Now it looks like I'm going to be both
assistant and patient.'' She handed me the bucket. ``If you could go fill this, I'll see if I
can't find us a patient.''

I smiled, and went to fill the bucket. When I returned, I noticed her shoes, jeans and top
were lying in a heap on the chair in the corner. Monique was lying on the casting table, wearing
only her bra and panties. I know that I've said this many times before, but she looked awesome.
Despite the fact that I'd casted her many times before, despite the fact that we were in love,
and very comfortable with one another, I still found that my heart raced a bit every time I
wrapped a cast on her beautiful body. Today was no different.

``Doctor,'' she started, trying to sound serious, ``The patient has bilateral fractures of the
tibia and fibula. The fractures have been reduced and now only need immobilization.''

I set the bucket down, and got to work.

\begin{thought}
Though she'd worn many casts so far in this interesting summer, Monique was still excited
every time Quinn encased some part of her. She loved every moment of the process, loved every
sensation. She always made sure to pay close attention to the way every step felt as it
occurred.

She loved the smooth, soft, cool feel of the stockinette being slid up first her left, then
her right leg. She loved the very slight compression of the elastic in the stockinette.

As Quinn began wrapping the padding on her left leg, she took note of how the pressure on
her leg increased slightly. She also noticed how her leg began to feel a bit warmer as the
padding reflected her body heat in the air conditioned room. Neither was ever enough to be
uncomfortable, just enough to know it was there. She could never deny that it felt very erotic
to her.

As Quinn tore open and dipped the first roll of fiberglass, she noticed the fruity smell,
and the very faint sounds of the tape being unrolled from itself as he wrapped it around her
thigh. The compression was increasing a bit, but still not uncomfortable. In fact, she found it
to be very comforting. She loved how it felt as he wrapped the tape around her knee, and then
kept working downward.

After a few minutes, he had fully encased her left leg from the upper thigh to her toes.
The cast was tickling her senses on several layers: The gentle pressure of the snugly (but not
tightly) wrapped fiberglass, the noticeable, but not unpleasant scent of the resin in the
fiberglass, the very faint sizzling sound it made as it dried, and of course, the sight of how
the purple material conformed perfectly to the contours of her leg.

With the left leg done, Quinn pulled off his gloves, and wrapped her right leg in padding.
Again she found the sensations exciting and erotic as he encased her right leg in purple
fiberglass from her hip to her toes the same way he'd done the left. The exothermic reaction was
progressing nicely on her left leg, and it was warm along the full length of the cast. The right
leg was starting to warm up in the thigh area. Though she knew she could and would wait, the
process of being casted aroused her sexually, as it always had.
\end{thought}

After I'd finished Monique's casts, I cleaned up a bit while we waited for the casts to
dry. When they'd had enough time to be well set, I asked Monique ``Is the patient ready to be
moved to her room?''

``Yes, doctor,'' she answered, keeping the mock serious tone. ``The casts have dried enough to
move her.''

I slid my arms underneath her, and picked her up. I carried her into the hospital room and
laid her gently in the bed. I stepped back and looked at her lying there.

``Have I ever told you that you're beautiful?'' I asked.

She smiled, making herself that much more beautiful. ``Yes, but you can tell me again.''

``I'd rather show you.'' I retrieved my sketchpad and pencil, and pulled up a chair.

As my pencil worked, I marveled at how her image took form on the paper. When I'd finished,
I showed her the drawing.

She nodded in approval. ``This is excellent, but my favorite form of your artwork is always
going to be what you do with sculpture,'' she said, running her hands up her casted thighs. She
then grabbed my shirt in her left hand, and pulled me into a long, passionate kiss.
