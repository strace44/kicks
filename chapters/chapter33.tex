Cassidy sat at her desk, looking at her notes, and thinking about the ongoing undercover
assignment. It was going nowhere. This guy was not the rapist they were thinking he might be. On
a weirdness scale of one to ten, he was about eleven and a half, but he was a gentleman about
it.

If being way out there on the oddball scale were a crime, they could give him life, but
other than a minor tax code violation, he was doing nothing wrong. This whole investigation was
a waste of time, money and resources. Not to mention the fact that she wasn't enjoying her role
in it.

``Looking for something that we both know isn't there?'' asked a voice from behind her.

She turned to see Johnson looking over her shoulder. ``No, I'm not even looking for it,
anymore,'' she said. ``We really need to pull the plug on this one. If the pervert we're looking
for is in this area, we're looking in the wrong place. The pervert we have is pretty harmless.''

``Well,'' Johnson said, ``Captain wants to see us- let's tell him.'' He nodded in the direction
of Captain Harmon's office, and turned toward it.

She got up, and followed Johnson into the captain's office. The captain was sitting at his
desk, looking through a file. ``Smith, Johnson- sit down.''

As they sat, he handed the file to Johnson. Johnson opened it to find an arrest report from
Lexington. Campus police had arrested a guy who'd drugged and date-raped a coed. When pressed,
he'd confessed to the serial rapes across the Midwest. As she read over Johnson's shoulder,
Cassidy wasn't surprised. She'd become convinced that Quinn wasn't the guy.

``Captain, I was really starting to think we were on a wild goose chase,'' she said.

``Yes, but we had to check up on it. Do we have anything at all on this Quinn?''

Cass spoke up. ``We have absolutely nothing other than a minor tax code violation. He pays
in cash, and doesn't ask for Social security numbers, so he can't be reporting any of this.''

``I'm not even sure that is a violation,'' added Johnson. ``It's definitely a violation if the
models don't report it, but I don't think he's in the wrong at all.''

``Either way, it's not our dance,'' Harmon said. ``This investigation is officially over. We
can't shut him down for being a nutjob. Next time you're supposed to model for him, both of you
go. Tell him who you are, maybe it will scare him off. In the meantime, I have a new case for
you two.''

Erin arrived at 5 minutes past 9:00 Monday morning. She wore denim shorts, a white t-shirt
and a sneaker on her right foot. Her new cast was light blue fiberglass. It came up high,
disappearing under the hem of her shorts. The knee was indeed, much straighter. I opened the
door for her, and when she walked in with her sideways gait, I could see the white stockinette
at the end peeking out just a bit.

``I'm sorry I'm late,'' She said.

``It's only five minutes, don't worry about it,'' I answered.

She headed into the parlor, where Monique was waiting for us. From her expression, it was
clear that she was shocked to see someone else there.

``Erin, this is Monique. She's going to help us today.''

``Hi,'' Erin said coolly.

\begin{thought}
``Hmm- I don't think she likes me being here much,'' Monique thought to herself. ``She doesn't
really act as though she has designs on Quinn, but she certainly acts as though she wants Quinn
(and every other man she sees) to have designs on her.''
\end{thought}

``Hello,'' replied Monique.

Erin turned to me. ``We're going to need help?'' She said, with eyebrows raised.

``Monique is my girlfriend, and she's also one of my models.''

\begin{thought}
Monique hadn't heard Quinn refer to her as his girlfriend before, but she liked the sound
of it.
\end{thought}

``I see.'' Her answer was a bit curt. ``So, what is on the agenda for today?''

I explained to her what we'd be doing, how Monique would help with making the large cast,
and what the pay would be. She nodded in agreement, and excused herself to the casting room to
undress.

When she'd closed the door behind her, Monique turned to me.

``Kind of chilly, isn't she?''

``I don't know.'' I answered. ``She's never acted like this before.''

``She's a queen bee.'' Monique answered.

I looked at her, puzzled.

``You haven't met the type? She's young and pretty, and she's used to being the center of
the attention of every man around. I'm sure she gets even more attention with her broken leg.
She probably sees me as a threat for your attention.'' Monique seemed amused by what she was
telling me.

``Well, you are a serious threat.''

``I'd better be, mister,'' she said with a sly smile.

``Trust me.'' I said, pulling her into a kiss. When we'd finished, she looked at me and said
``I do.''

``Good. Now let's go make a shoulder spica,'' I said, picking up the envelope with Erin's pay
for the day and heading to the casting room.

Erin was ready for us. She was sitting on the casting table with her leg up. She had
undressed to her black bra and panties. She looked fantastic, but even in her old jeans and t-
shirt, Monique looked better.

I would have preferred to cast her standing up, but because of her leg, I decided to have
her sit on a stool while we worked. I got the stool for her, and when she had sat down, I got my
homemade leg rest and lifted her leg into it. I asked her to lower her bra strap on the right
side, and when she was done, I started with the stockinette.

I pulled off a length of 12'' stockinette, and slipped it over her head, and pulled it down
to her hips. I made slits along each side down to her armpits, and taped the front and back
sections together over her shoulders. I then took some 3'' stockinette, and slid it up her arm
to
the armpit. I cut it off at the fingertips, and made a slit for the thumb. I finished with a
small section of 1'' stockinette that I placed over her thumb.

When that was done, I asked Monique for some 6'' padding, which I started wrapping at her
waist. I worked upward, ending at her armpits. The last roll of 6'' padding started below her
breasts, and covered the left shoulder and upper arm. While Monique held her arm in position, I
then started with the 4'' padding, working from her upper arm to the wrist. I finished with 1''
padding covering the thumb and hand. I asked her to hold her arm in that position, and Monique
and I put on out gloves.

\begin{thought}
As she helped Quinn build the cast on Erin, Monique was feeling several different emotions.
She found herself envying the cast. Quinn had put big casts on her before and she'd loved it
every time. Still she found it fascinating to watch him making a cast on someone else, where she
could watch his every move as he created the cast. It was similar to watching him as he made his
drawings. She found herself a bit surprised that while Erin was very beautiful, she didn't feel
jealous or threatened by her. She knew she loved Quinn totally and completely, and she knew she
trusted him the same way.
\end{thought}

I tore open the first roll of 5'' white fiberglass, and started at her waist, working
upward. As I was wrapping her torso, she began to talk.

``Quinn, there is something I need to tell you.''

``What's that?'' I asked, keeping to my work.

``I was late this morning because I stopped at my job- the normal one. They're going to let
me come back to work now that I don't have to use crutches anymore.''

``That's good news.'' I sad, wrapping wet fiberglass around her chest and left shoulder.

``Well, it's good and bad,'' she went on. ``I'm not going to be able to do this after today.''

``Well, while I'll miss working with you, and I'm sure my employer will miss seeing your
work, I am happy that your life is getting back closer to normal,'' I said, tearing open and
dipping a roll of 4'' white fiber.

She remained silent for a while as I worked on her arm. Monique carefully held her arm in
position with the palms of her hands, to avoid denting the setting cast. I worked carefully with
2'' fiberglass over the hand and thumb, being careful not to bunch the casting tape, nor to get
it too thick. The water droplets sweating up on the surface told me that the fiber was setting
nicely. I folded up the stockinette and padding at her waist, then trimmed the stockinette on
her upper chest and folded it over. I then used more 5'' tape to anchor the stockinette, and
give
another couple of layers to the cast over her torso. A final roll of 2'' anchored the hand and
thumb stockinette, and the cast was finished.

``That will need to dry just a bit before we can move you.'' I said. ``Monique, I'll take a
turn at holding that arm if you're getting tired.'' I moved in and supported Erin's arm, and
Monique moved away, pulled off her gloves, and began picking up the wrappers from the casting
tape.

``Quinn, I do appreciate working with you,'' Erin said. ``The money sure helped me out. I'm
not sure what I'd have done without it this past month.''

``Erin, I've enjoyed working with you, and my employer- our employer has enjoyed your work.''

When the water droplets had stopped beading up on the surface of the cast, I wiped it off
with a towel, and helped Erin off of the stool. I stayed close as she walked to the living room,
in case she lost her balance. Watching her hobble along, swinging the casted leg out as she
walked slowly in her new body cast was quite a treat.

\begin{thought}
Watching Erin do her best at walking enthralled Monique. She imagined herself in the
situation. She imagined the feel of the casts, the clumsiness of trying to walk and keep her
balance. She decided that she'd have Quinn cast her the same way sometime. This was something
she simply had to try.
\end{thought}

In the living room, I took several pictures, as usual. Because one appeal of a casted woman
to me was to watch them trying to function as much as possible, despite whatever cast or casts
she was wearing, I had her stand and lean back against the wall for the sketch.

When the sketch was done, I had Monique get the wheelchair, and we helped Erin sit. I
pushed her back to the casting room, and we helped her out of the chair and onto the table. I
got the saw, and cut the cast along the top of the left arm, up the right side, and finally up
the left side, and underneath the arm. I then took scissors, and cut through the padding and
stockinette along the two cuts on the left side. I pulled the cast open, and Erin leaned out as
I pulled the cast away to her right.

Monique helped her brush off the fiberglass flecks, and Erin began to dress herself. It was
interesting watching how she had to bend almost in half to get her shorts back on over the cast.

When she was dressed, I handed her the envelope, and she thanked me again for everything. I
saw her to the door, and watched her walk down the steps, one at a time.

Monique joined me. ``Well, you're down to two models, now.'' She said.

``I think that two is one too many.'' I replied.

``I don't know about that. I kind of enjoyed this.'' Monique said. ``Sure I was a bit jealous-
of the cast, not of her. I wanted the cast to be on me, and for us to 'play' with it for a
while, but watching and helping was fun, too. I'd like to do a long leg walking cast and
shoulder spica together sometime. I'd like to wear it for at least a couple of days. That is, if
I can find someone to take care of me while I'm so helpless.''

``I think both could be arranged.'' I said.
