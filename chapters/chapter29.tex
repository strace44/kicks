\chapter{~}
I watched the Sunday evening sun set with my new house guest. We were sitting on the deck,
holding hands. The setting was very peaceful despite the ugly stump where the beautiful Oak had
stood, and the crushed pickup sitting in front of the garage. We sat in silence, and I was
pleasantly surprised to find the silence was in no way awkward. It was good just to be with her.

We'd been through an intense weekend, to say the least. I'm sure we were both a bit
emotionally exhausted, yet I found myself content, just sitting with her, hand in hand.

Monique broke the silence.

``Quinn, let's go to Cedar Point. I'll treat.''

For those of you who may not know, Cedar Point is an amusement park in northern Ohio. It is
one of the oldest amusement parks in the United States, and is renowned for its great roller
coasters.

``Are you serious?''

``I'm serious as a heart attack.'' She said with a smile. ``I've got some extra cash, thanks to
this weekend, and I have someone to share it with, also thanks to this weekend. We could leave
tomorrow.''

I was taken aback, yet the idea was appealing. It had been a while since I'd done any roller
coaster riding, and Cedar Point is rated the best park in the world for coasters. As my mind was
starting to like the idea, I thought of Erin, who would be here at 9:00 tomorrow morning, and
Samantha coming Wednesday.

``Monique, I have a model coming tomorrow morning.''

Her face fell a bit at this, then she said ``We could leave after you finish.''

I was about to tell her about Samantha, and how one day wasn't enough time to fully
experience the park, when the side gate opened, and my landlord walked in.

``Hello, Mr. Moore,'' I said.

``Hello, Harlan. I was just wondering if the power had been restored, here. I tried calling,
but couldn't get through.''

``The power is back,'' I replied. ``But it sounds like the phone is still out. To be honest, I
hadn't checked.''

He went on. ``I also wanted to let you know that the insurance adjuster will be out to check
out the house tomorrow. He'll need to get inside. Will you be home?''

I hadn't considered it, but if there was going to be someone in the house, I would rather
not have to explain why I was putting casts on a perfectly healthy woman. Thinking quickly, I
said ``I'll be here some, but not all day.''

``OK,'' Mr. Moore said, but I'll need to give him a key so he can get in.''

``That's fine,'' I replied.

``Hopefully, I'll have the repairmen out Tuesday to start work. Wednesday at the latest,'' He
said.

Hmm- Insurance adjusters and repairmen. My little casting studio was starting to look like
it wasn't going to be very suitable for casting this week. On the spur of the moment, I said
``actually, Mr. Moore, I'm thinking of taking off for a few days on a trip.''

``That might not be a bad idea. Just make sure not to leave anything valuable lying around.''

``I won't.''

With that, he said goodbye and left. I turned to Monique, who was looking at me with a
playful smile. ``It sounds like someone may have reconsidered,'' she said.

``Well, I won't be able to work in a construction zone. And it's not everyday that a
beautiful woman asks me to go ride roller coasters.''

``A beautiful woman asked you to go ride coasters with her?'' Monique said indignantly. ``Who
is she? I'll kick her ass!''

I shook my head, smiled, and kissed her.

``And besides,'' she added. ``Just because we're going away for a few days, it doesn't mean you
can't work.'' She lifted her eyebrows at this last comment.

Monday morning, I woke up, showered and went downstairs to wake Monique. I really wanted to
have her in my bed with me, but I knew it wasn't time for that, at least not yet.

Erin wasn't coming today. I'd used the cell phone to call her last night. She wouldn't have
been able to make it anyway. She'd been at her doctor's office when the storm hit. She had told
me that they were going to take off her cast, and replace it with a shorter cast she could walk
on. The power went out when they were cutting the cast, and they'd had to tape it back up and
told her to come back today. I also had called Samantha. I got an answering service, and left
her a message that we wouldn't be able to work this week due to repairs of the storm damage.

After Monique had showered and dressed, she informed me that she needed to go do a bit of
shopping before we left.

``OK. We can get some breakfast, and then go shopping. We can't leave until the truck gets
towed away.''

I got the bike out of the garage, and we rode off through the devastated town. Cleanup was
still going on en masse. We found a restaurant open, and stopped for breakfast.

While we were eating, she kept talking about the trip. She clearly was excited about it.

``This is going to be a fun trip. I know I mentioned doing some casting while we're there,
but if it's too much like work for you, I'll be very content just to be with you.''

``Monique, what made you think that casting was like work to me? Granted, it is my job, but
when did I ever say I didn't enjoy it?''

\begin{thought}
OK, now I know I'm dreaming, Monique thought to herself. He'd never really said so until
now, but she had secretly hoped that Quinn enjoyed this as much as she did. Saturday night, when
she'd opened up to him about her feelings, she was so happy to learn that he was attracted to
her that she'd not asked about his feelings about casting. She'd been afraid of what she might
hear.
\end{thought}

``So, you enjoy this weird 'hobby' too?''

``Yes, very much,'' I replied. ``It was no accident that I hooked up with this job.''

``I think I'm in heaven,'' she said, as she pulled me into a kiss.

``So, let's go shopping, and get on the road,'' I announced.

Not expecting to find many stores open locally, we headed out of town and across the state
line into Ohio. We went to the Cincinnati area, and found a mall that was opening for the day.
She bought some clothes and a pair of sandals. While she was in one of the stores, I waited
outside under the premise that I was going to call the boss about our plans. I hated lying to
her, but she'd said that she didn't like rich people, and I could not shake that thought. To be
honest, that thought was starting to scare me- a lot.

When she returned, I told her that we'd been given the green light to get any supplies we
might need, and to cast as much as we wanted while on the trip. She was very pleased to hear
this.

Shortly after noon, we arrived back at the house. The phone company was there, and the
repairman informed me that he was just finishing up and the phone should be working. The cable
television repairman was just arriving to put those lines back up. I parked the bike, and
Monique and I went inside to pack some clothes for the trip. I also packed supplies and tools
from the casting room. As Monique was helping me load the materials in the Mustang, she asked
``Is there enough left to make me a traveling cast?''

``You haven't been out of the body cast much more than 24 hours.'' I said. ``You already want
to be in another cast?''

``Sure- why not?''

I was wondering now if I was the one in heaven. She really DID like wearing casts. My
little voice be damned, she was pulling me in.

``Alright. How about a nice leg cast for the road?''

She liked the idea, so I instructed her to take off her shorts and shoes while I retrieved
a few things from the car. When I returned, she was sitting on the casting table in her tank top
and underwear. I slid stockinette up to her left thigh, and then wrapped it from the top down in
padding. I filled my bucket with water, and then began tearing open the packages of pink
fiberglass. I wrapped her leg from slightly higher than mid-thigh downward, putting enough of a
bend in the knee to make sure she'd be comfortable sitting in the car on the drive.

\begin{thought}
Monique felt almost in another world as Quinn wrapped her leg in pink fiberglass. It was a
delightful array of sensations for her. Watching the man she was falling in love with wrapping
the pink tape, the fruity smell, the feeling of gentle pressure as his hands encased her leg in
rapidly setting fiberglass. She wasn't sure where things would lead between them, though she
knew where she wanted them to lead. She decided to just enjoy the moment, and the moment was
truly wonderful.
\end{thought}

I packed the items we'd used in the car while Monique remained in the cast room, waiting
for her cast to dry. I got the aluminum crutches for her. She hoisted herself up from the table,
and hobbled around the room.

``OK, I'm ready to go!''

``We just have to wait for the tow truck to get here. As soon as they haul the truck off, we
can get going.''

We passed the next hour just talking about our trip. We were both pretty excited about
going, and it showed. She wanted to check something online, but we had to wait until the cable
technician was done, since I have a cable modem for internet connection. When service was
restored, she went to the Cedar point website, and was surfing through pages rapidly until she
found what she was looking for, and called me over.''

``Quinn, come look at this!''

She was reading from a page with tips for guests with disabilities. She showed me that
certain guests can get a special access pass that allows them front of line access. She then
went to another page that showed that they would let guests with casts ride if their casts did
not cover the knee or elbow. She then looked at me slyly.

``Are you thinking what I'm thinking?'' She asked.

``I'm thinking you want to go to the park in a cast, just so we don't have to wait in
lines.''

``No, I want to go to the park in a cast for the fun of it,'' She answered. ``I'm just
thinking that the front of the line pass seals the deal.''

``I'm thinking that you're incorrigible.'' I said.

She laughed at that, and the laughter was interrupted by a knock at the door. I went to
answer it, and it was the towing service. I took him out back and showed him the truck. He made
a comment about how bad the truck was damaged (as though I couldn't see for myself) and went to
back his truck up to it. I left him to his work and went back inside.

We closed up the house, and when the truck was hauled off, we headed out. We stopped for
lunch, and Monique got some long looks from guys at the restaurant. She was quite a sight, a
stunning brunette, seeming to be having a lot of fun in spite of a broken leg.

We had a great trip north, alternating between talking and just listening to music. We
weren't in a terrible hurry to get there- we planned on taking the whole afternoon. We made
several stops to stretch our legs. Well, I stretched my legs, and she stretched one of hers. On
one of the stops, I decided to do a sketch of her with the car. She stood in front of the car on
her crutches while I drew. When I was done, I showed her my work, which she approved of. We then
continued north.

We arrived at the park at about 4:00 p.m. local time. We headed around to the hotel inside
the park, and checked in. Our room had a great view of Lake Erie. When I had carried in our
luggage, including the supplies, we went out on the balcony overlooking the lake and watched the
sailboats out n the lake by the lighthouse. Monique broke the silence.

``So, what shall we get up to tonight?''

``Why not go and hit a few rides before the park closes?'' I asked.

She liked the idea, but couldn't ride in a long leg cast. I assumed the rooms around us
were probably empty, and using the cast saw wouldn't disturb anyone. I used the cast saw to cut
away the portion of her cast over the knee, and then pulled back some stockinette and padding. I
wet a roll of pink fiberglass, and anchored it down, then wrapped down to her foot to add some
strength to the cast.

We sat and watched the boats awhile while the cast dried, then I strapped a cast shoe on her
foot, and we headed out to the park.
