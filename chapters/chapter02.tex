\chapter{Adrienne}
My advertisement seeking models came out with the paper on Wednesday. Thursday morning at a
quarter past nine, the phone rang:

``Hello, my name is Adrienne. I'm interested in the modeling job you advertised in Kicks.''

She turned out to be a student at the university, which came as no surprise, of course. She
didn't have any modeling experience, but I wasn't asking for that, anyway. She asked about the
nature of the modeling, given the fact that I had stated that ``An open mind is necessary'' in
my ad. I told her it would be best to discuss it at an interview, and we agreed to meet at the
studio later that day.

When she arrived, I was quite pleased. She had light brown hair, nice features, very
attractive. She would definitely make an excellent cast model, no doubt about it. I hoped that
she would agree to sit for me.

I invited her into the parlor to sit, and introduced myself.

``I'm Harlan Quinn and I am what you could call a fetish artist.''

I couldn't help but notice the bit of surprise that crossed her face.

``Oh, you mean like leather and latex? That sort of thing?''

``Well, Adrienne, those are certainly fetishes, but the one I work in is a bit off of the
beaten path, even as fetishes go. What you will be doing, if you take this job,'' I paused- I
almost felt like I was watching someone else do this, ``is this: You will come to this studio in
the afternoon. You will be placed in a plaster or fiberglass cast, or possibly more than one.
Afterwards, I will take some photographs of you, and then sketch you. After the sketch is done,
I will remove the cast or casts, and will pay you three hundred dollars.''

She looked shocked. ``You mean a cast like for a broken arm or broken leg or something?''

``Yes, just like one a doctor would give you for a broken arm or broken leg- made the same
way, with the same materials. It's an odd fetish, but there are people who like it. Have you
ever worn a cast before?'' She said that she had not, but that she'd had a friend in eighth
grade who had broken a leg, and that the cast had looked to her like quite an ordeal.

She asked questions about the application, and removal. I could tell she was interested. I
told her if she would feel more comfortable having a friend present during this, that she was
more than welcome to bring one along. Male, female- it didn't matter to me, as long as she were
comfortable.

``How will you get the cast off?''

``I use the same tools for removal that a doctor would. They are quick, safe, and painless''

``OK, I think I can do this,'' she said. ``What sort of cast would I wear?''

I hadn't been sure, but I knew I had to reply quickly- if I sounded the least bit unsure of
myself, it might make her uneasy. Leg casts are definitely some of my favorites, so I'll start
there.

``Well, Adrienne, I think I'd like to place your legs in casts, both of them. One will stop
below the knee, and the other will go all the way to your hip. If you think you can do that, we
can set up a day for it.''

She thought for a few moments, and then shrugged- ``Sure- I'll do it! When do you want to?''

I asked her when her class schedule allowed her a free afternoon and evening. ``How about
tomorrow?'' she said. I asked if she could be at the studio at three and she agreed.

``What should I wear? Does it matter?''

``Well, wear whatever you like on the way here. Since this art is fetish driven, you'll need
to have something fairly erotic to wear for the sitting. Bring a swimsuit if you have one, and
some attractive lingerie if you have that. Nothing too revealing, though- the ad promised no
nudity, and that promise will be kept.''

She got up, said ``See you tomorrow at three!'' turned and left.

After she left, I sat there, almost dumbfounded. Hard to believe, but I was actually going
to get to cast a woman. I've wanted to all my life, but never have, and now it's going to
happen! I lit a cigarette, and sipped my soda, as I contemplated the final preparations.

I went to the studio, and started loading the supply cart. I debated on whether to use
plaster or fiberglass. I have practiced with both, making casts on myself, so I could do either
one and make a nice looking cast with no problems. I looked through my cache of supplies.
Anything was possible, really. I had enough casting supplies on hand to keep a big city hospital
stocked for a couple of weeks, probably: Stockinette, padding, plaster and fiberglass in all
sizes and colors.

I decided to cast Adrienne in plaster, as the first casts I remember seeing as a child were
all done in plaster. So, to the cart, I added 12 rolls of 4 inch plaster, and 6 rolls of 6 inch
plaster, in addition to several rolls of 4 inch padding, and a roll of 4 inch stockinette.

Adrienne arrived at about ten minutes past three, carrying an overnight bag.

``Sorry I'm late, I hope it's OK.''

``No problem, come on in,''

She apologized again, saying she was trying to talk her roommate into coming along, but with
no luck. ``But,'' she added, ``you look pretty honest and harmless, so I just gave her the
address here, and came alone.''

``That was a smart thing to do,'' I told her. ``I applaud you for your caution. I'd never
hurt anyone, but you barely know me. To you, I'm just a guy with a weird turn-on. Would you like
a soda?''

I got a soda for each of us, and asked her to come with me. I led her to the room I had set
up as a casting room. She looked around, taking it in, the table, the small footstools I had
gotten to use as props for casted legs, the cart of supplies, and the crutches and wheelchair in
the corner.

``Will I be needing those?'' she asked, pointing in the direction of the crutches and chair.

``We'll use the wheelchair to get you to the parlor when the casts have set,'' I told her.

She started poking through the supplies a bit, out of curiosity.

``Let me show you the choices of what I brought to wear,'' She said opening the bag she was
carrying. She produced a one-piece swimsuit that wasn't bad, but it didn't seem quite right to
me. She then brought out a satin nightgown and a babydoll style teddy.

``Of course, there's always these'' and as she said this, she raised her sweatshirt to show
a blue bra, then unfastened her Levis and pulled them down far enough to show the matching
underwear. That was what I was looking for.

``Let's just go with what you have on under your clothes right now, and we can start
whenever you're ready'' She took off her shoes and socks, slipped her jeans and sweatshirt off,
folded them neatly, and placed them in the corner. She then hopped up on the table and said
``I'm ready whenever you are''

I took an envelope from the cart, and opened it. I removed four one hundred dollar bills
from it, showed them to her, then replaced them in the envelope.

``I know I told you three hundred dollars, but I got the OK for an extra hundred since there
was an extra cast involved.''

``Great! I appreciate that!''

I then placed the envelope with her clothes. ``There. I wanted you to see the cash before
you see the casts'' She smiled and nodded. I could tell she was still a bit nervous.

I rolled the cart to the table. I took the bucket, excused myself, and went to fill it with
warm water. Adrienne was sipping her soda when I got back.

``OK, here we go,'' I told her, as I took the roll of 4 inch stockinette from the cart. She
said nothing as I did this.

I slipped the stockinette over her left leg, to just past the knee, explaining that it
served as a base for the cast, and kept the padding from itching. I cut it off just past the
toes, and smoothed out the wrinkles. Propping her left leg on the rest I had made, I then moved
to the right leg, where I brought it all the way up to her hip, being very careful to do it in a
professional manner. I then cut it off just below the toes, then propped it on the other rest.

Next, I brought out a roll of 4 inch padding. ``Adrienne, this is the padding. It gives a
bit of comfort to the cast, and keeps the plaster from directly contacting your skin.'' Again
she only nodded. I hoped that her nerves would be a bit more calm when she actually sat for me,
as I would prefer a smile on her face.

Since she wasn't going to be walking on these casts, I didn't think that heavily padding
them was necessary. With the left leg, I started at the toes, and overlapped the previous wrap
by one half. This gave her a double thickness of padding, to the knee. Next, the right leg,
wrapped the same way, only going much higher, stopping at the top of the thigh.

There she was, stockinette and padding applied, ready for the plaster. I stepped back and
looked at her and nodded to myself.

``Well, we're ready for the plaster. Are you still OK with this?'' I asked.

``Yes, it's actually sort of fascinating'' she replied. ``You seem to really know what
you're doing with this. Have you done it before?''

``Yes, I have. You're not dealing with a rookie, here.'' I told her with a smile. She smiled
back, and I got back to work.

I started with her left leg. I tore open the first roll of plaster, and dipped it. ``As this
starts to set, you will feel some heat from it, but I promise you it will not get anywhere close
to burning you,'' I told her as I began to wrap her foot.

I started with the ankle, working my way to the toes, then back up past the ankle. The
second roll started at the toes, building thickness, and continued over the ankle. The third
roll started at the knee, and worked down until it met up with the plaster already at her foot.
The fourth and fifth rolls repeated this, until I had a good, strong, thick base. I worked the
plaster in, smoothing it with my hands. The cast was looking great.

``It's starting to get warm on my foot,'' she announced.

``Yes, that's quite normal'' I replied.

I wiped my hands off, took my scissors, and trimmed the padding back to be almost flush with
the plaster. I folded the stockinette back over the cast, and used some of the wet plaster to
hold it in place for the moment. Another roll of plaster, starting at the foot, to anchor the
stockinette and padding, followed by another roll, doing the same thing, only from the top of
the cast. I could feel the heat on my hands as I smoothed out the rapidly setting plaster. The
cast was finished, and it looked great!

``Well, there's one leg done.'' I told her, as I gently placed her foot on the padded stool.
``We'll just set that one here to dry. Are you still OK?''

She smiled and said ``I'm fine- this isn't so bad. And even if it were, I'm being paid very
well for it, so I could deal with it, no problems!''

``OK, then- lets move to the other leg'' I told her. I then turned back to the cart.

I helped her scoot to the edge of the table, allowing me access to her right thigh. I tore
open a roll of six inch plaster, dipped it, and started to work on her long leg cast. I wrapped
the first roll over the knee, building a good strong base there. I didn't try to bring it all
the way up on the first roll. The second and third rolls started at the end of the padding and
worked to just past the knee and back. The fourth roll of six inch started at the top, and
worked down to near the ankle. I then folded over the stockinette and padding at the top, and
anchored it with the fifth roll of six inch, smoothing it out as I went. Then, I moved to four
inch plaster, starting at the shin, and working it to the toes. Four rolls of four inch plaster
later, I was ready to fold over and anchor the stockinette at the toes. I smoothed out the
plaster over the whole cast, and placed that leg on the other stool to let it dry.

``There you are,'' I said. ``We need to just let that dry for about an hour before we can
move you to the other room. It won't be completely dry, but it will be dry enough to move you.
Do you need anything?''

``How about another soda?'' she asked.

I cleaned the plaster from both of us, and we talked for awhile as the plaster dried. After
it seemed pretty well set, I picked her up, and placed her in the wheelchair. I snapped a few
photos of her in the wheelchair. I rolled her into the parlor, where I helped her into a chair.
I snapped a few more photos, and as I was doing so, the inspiration hit me.

``Let's have you lie on the chair, with your legs resting against the backrest.'' I said.
``I think that's how I want to draw you.''

I helped her change positions, and as she relaxed, she lowered one of her bra straps down to
her upper arm.

``There,'' she said, ``That should look pretty good!'' She lowered her head, allowing her
hair to spill down.

Pretty good wasn't an accurate description, she looked fantastic! I snapped a photo of her
this way, then grabbed my tablet and pencils, and went to work furiously.

An hour later, the sketch was done, and I was very pleased with the way it turned out. I
helped her back to a proper sitting position, and showed her the drawing.

``Wow, that's really good- you are very talented! It looks just like me!'' She exclaimed.

``That was the idea.'' I said with a smile. ``OK, are you ready to get out of those?''

I picked her up, placed her back in the wheelchair, and took her back to the table. I lifted
her up onto the table, and got my Stryker saw and bandage scissors. She looked a bit startled by
the saw. ``Don't worry, this saw will not cut you- it is unable to.'' I then turned the saw on,
and placed the oscillating blade against my bare hand to show this. Her relief was obvious on
her face, so I started to work. I cut both casts along both the inside and outside of her legs,
using an in and out motion. I cut small triangular sections from the insides of both ankles and
the right knee, allowing me to turn with the scissors. I then used the scissors to cut the
padding and stockinette along the insides of her legs, and slipped the casts off of her. It was
odd, seeing how the stockinette had imprinted it's pattern on her legs.

``You are all done, Adrienne.'' I told her. ``Thank you for working with me, you were an
excellent model, and I enjoyed the whole experience.''

As she got dressed, she asked ``So, who will be seeing the photos and the drawing? Will they
be seen by a lot of people?''

``Well, that depends upon what my patron wishes to do with them, but I think he keeps them
pretty much to himself.''

``Patron?'' she asked.

``Yes, he's the man who pays for all of this. He loves the sight of casted women, and foots
the bill for all of what I do.''

She shrugged and said ``Well, he pays very well,'' placing the envelope into her bag. ``If
he wants to see more of me, maybe we can work together again. Let me give you my number.'' She
wrote her number down, which I placed in my pocket. ``Thanks again,'' she said, as she turned to
go. As soon as she was gone, I turned and looked at the freshly removed casts on the floor, and
started to clean up. Alone.
