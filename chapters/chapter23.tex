\chapter{}
Friday morning, I grabbed a quick shower, and then sat down with the morning paper,
drinking a coke as I waited for Monique. Today's adventure promised to be interesting. It was
only two casts, but she was really going to be compromised in mobility.

It's a good thing Monique was a bit used to this. This type of adventure might be a bit
much for Erin. I really wish Erin took to this more. Maybe she'd be more accepting of it she
weren't injured and medically confined to a cast already. Hopefully, I can keep working with her
after she heals. Maybe she'll warm up to it then. Maybe the attention she is getting with her
cast will be more appealing once it isn't an everyday thing. Maybe I'm just having a wishful
fantasy, too.

Monique was really looking forward to today's adventure. She always looked forward to
Quinn casting her, but today promised to be fun. She was finally admitting to herself that she
enjoyed this for two reasons: Quinn AND the casts. She still had no idea how to act on it, but
at least she knew what it was that drew her to it, and was willing to admit it to herself.

On the seat next to her was her bag, with the lingerie and swimsuits that fit the
adventure as Quinn had described it. In addition, the clothes she was wearing would work with
today's casts if they decided to go out in public, which she hoped they would. She didn't think
she could bring herself to suggest it, but she was ready to agree if he mentioned it.

She parked in front of the Victorian house that was Quinn's studio, grabbed her bag, and
headed for the door.

I opened the door to Monique's knock. As always, she looked awesome. Today, she wore jeans
that made her legs look even longer than normal, and a red tank top. Most men like tank tops for
the way they accentuate a woman's chest, and I'm no exception. But, more than that, I love how
they expose a woman's shoulders. I'm not sure why, but there's just something very sensual about
the shoulders. Maybe I'm just weird. Or maybe just weirder than I thought.

I invited Monique in, and she went straight to the casting room. I followed her in. She
sat on the casting table, and I stood near the door.

``I'm really going to be helpless today, aren't I? She said.

``Yes, very. If you think it's too much, we can do something less.''

``No, no,'' she said quickly. ``This should be interesting. I'm kind of wondering how much
I can do for myself with these casts.''

``I'm thinking you won't be able to do much,'' I replied. ``If you get uncomfortable, just
say the word, and I'll have you out in 15 minutes.''

``I'll be fine. Are we doing the casts in fiberglass or plaster?'' she asked.

``Plaster. I know it's heavier, and takes longer to dry, but I think it looks better.''

\begin{thought}
``So do I,'' thought Monique to herself. ``Plus, I also get to feel your hands molding the
cast longer through plaster.'' She liked the fiberglass cast that they had done last week. The
fast drying time had made it easier to get out to the park quicker. She also liked the fact that
fiberglass could be obtained in a lot of colors. ``But, in the end, feeling those hands on my
body, though the setting plaster is so much nicer than fast dry times and colors,'' she thought.
\end{thought}

``Well, let me show you what I brought to wear.'' She said as she opened her bag. She
brought out a couple of 2 piece swimsuits that I'd seen before. Someday, we'd have to use them,
but when she brought out the lingerie, I knew it would not be today. In the lingerie, there was
a black, corset outfit that I instantly knew would be it. I told her my choice, and left her to
change.

When I returned, she was again sitting on the table, but looking much different- much
better. The corset had garters attached to it, and she'd brought the stockings along, and now
had them on.

``Wow, you look great,'' I said before I knew what I was doing.

``Thank you,'' Monique said, feeling a flush on her cheeks. She was a bit surprised
feeling it- she was complimented by guys a lot, but it was different when Quinn said it.
Probably only because she wanted to hear it from Quinn.

Monique really looked great. I had to snap myself back to reality by reminding myself
about her personality. Reminding myself of her fondness for money, and all the other women just
like her that I had known, I was able to get back to business.

``Well,'' I started, ``we can get to it if you're ready.''

\begin{thought}
``Damn, he's got that cloud of professionalism back.'' Monique said to herself. ``But for
a minute there, he dropped it. Maybe I can get past it again.''
\end{thought}

She smiled and said ``I'm ready anytime.''

I took the four inch stockinette and cut off two sections about three feet long. I took
one, and slid it all the way up her left arm, bunching it slightly at the armpit. I took my
scissors and cut a small slit about four inches from the end for her thumb to pass through. When
I touched her, I felt a very slight start, as though I had startled her. I knew that I hadn't
touched her in an inappropriate way, so I really didn't know the reason for it. Perhaps I had
picked up a little static electricity and not noticed when I shocked her.

I repeated the process for the right arm. I then positioned the right arm with the elbow
at ninety degrees and the palm turned inward. From the cart, I took a roll of four inch padding,
and wrapped padding from the armpit to the wrist, overlapping each turn by half. I then took a
roll of one inch padding, and wrapped the hand, cutting off the remainder of the roll when I was
finished. I repeated the process for her other arm, but I positioned the hand with the palm
facing upward this time.

I stepped back and looked at her, and it was certainly impressive: The padding on her arms
contrasted nicely with her tanned skin and black clothing. (What little there was of it)

I asked Monique ``So, are you ready to lose your arms for a while?''

``Sure,'' she replied. ``Do you mind if I have a cigarette before we do? It might be hard
afterward, and you still need to fill your bucket.''

Now I was the one startled. I had completely forgotten not only to fill the bucket, but
also to get her money. I couldn't believe she let me forget that.

``Yes, and I still need to get your money, too.''

``Oh yes, that too,'' she said. She sounded like she was almost as surprised by the fact
as I was.

I offered her one of my cigarettes, which she took. She was being very slow and careful
with her movements so as not to disturb the stockinette and padding on her arms. I needed to get
my thoughts back together, so I lit one for myself. I took the bucket and left to fill it and
get her envelope.

\begin{thought}
While Quinn was gone, Monique thought over his behavior. It wasn't terribly strange, but
it was certainly different for him. ``He seems distracted,'' she thought to herself. ``I hope
there's nothing going on.'' Her mind raced with disastrous possibilities: and the thought that
troubled her most was ``I hope nothing is threatening what we do every Friday.''
\end{thought}

By the time I had returned to the casting room, bucket of warm water in one hand, pay
envelope in the other, I was back in control of my thoughts. Monique seemed lost in thought when
I opened the door, but she snapped out of it almost instantly. I set the bucket on the cart, and
put the envelope with her bag.

``Quinn,'' she said ``are you alright?''

Damn- she'd noticed.

``Yes, I'm fine.'' I said as I took plaster rolls from the box, cut open the ends of the
packages, and set them on the cart.

``You just seem a bit distracted today. It's not like you.''

``No, no- I'm good.'' I said with a smile. ``Are you ready to get plastered?''

``Yes.''

I had a roll of very thin white plastic that I had picked up from a party supply outlet
store. It was meant to be used as tablecloth, but it made perfect drop cloth. I cut a long
section of it, and wrapped around Monique's body and taped it in place.

``That will protect your clothes from plaster splatters.'' I said.

``Good idea, but plaster washes out.'' She smiled. ``I've already learned that.''

I couldn't help but smile back. ``I guess you would have learned that.''

``Occupational hazard, but it's no big deal,'' she said with another slight smile.

I dipped a roll of three inch plaster and began wrapping her left hand. I worked the
plaster over her hand, folding the roll into a ``Z'' shape where it covered the area between her
thumb and forefinger. It is always tricky to cast a hand, but this one turned out pretty good.
The roll of plaster was enough to do the whole hand, and slightly past the wrist. I folded the
stockinette and padding back at the fingers, and dipped another roll of three inch plaster. I
used this to anchor the stockinette and padding, and worked it up the forearm. I then started
with four inch plaster rolls to finish the arm.

\begin{thought}
Monique was enjoying being casted, but something Quinn had said bothered her. ``I wonder
what it means, if it means anything.'' She thought as she watched Quinn wrapping plaster around
her left elbow. She was enjoying watching and feeling his hands wrapping and smoothing the
creamy plaster.
\end{thought}

``So,'' she started, ``do you like to travel?'' It was a lame question, but he'd actually
dropped the professionalism earlier, and she wanted to see if she could get him to do it again.

``I've traveled a bit,'' he replied as he continued wrapping plaster on her upper arm. She
noticed that he was careful not to touch her breast as he was doing it. ``It wouldn't be the end
of the world if he did,'' she thought.

``Actually,'' he replied, ``my favorite form of travel is around the United States. I've
been overseas a few times, and it was fine. But I like it better seeing this country. No
offense.''

``None taken,'' she said. ``I may have been born in France, but I am very pleased to be
American, now. We have deserts, mountains, forests- a little bit of everything.''

Monique sure was chatty today, I thought to myself, finishing wrapping the plaster at her
left armpit. After I anchored the stockinette and padding, I dampened a sponge and started to
lightly buff the plaster around her hand. The sponge was a trick I had learned to make plaster
super-smooth.

``One silly pleasure that I have in America,'' she continued, ``Are the amusement parks. I
love the rides.''

``Really?''

``Yes, I know it's childish, but I love them.''

``Actually, Monique, I do too. Especially the roller coasters.''

As I casted her right arm, we discussed the different amusement parks we'd been to, the
different roller coasters we'd ridden. She'd been to the two local parks, and a few on the upper
east coast. I, of course, had been to many more, but didn't tell her quite how many.

Monique was quite contented with the moment. Her left arm was warm with the setting
plaster, but the heat was starting to subside. The cast on her right arm was done, and starting
to heat up. Quinn was rubbing the right arm with a sponge, and they were having a nice
conversation about a shared interest.

I cleaned the plaster splatters from Monique's hands and shoulders as we conversed. I took
off the drop cloth, and was again stunned by how she looked. I was more stunned by what she said
next.

``It would be interesting to see people's reactions if I went out in public like this.''

I was floored, but thought fast enough to say ``Monique, dressed the way you are, you'd
get interesting reactions without the casts.''

``That's not what I meant. I mean in normal clothes, with the arm casts.''

``I imagine you'd get a lot of second looks. Did you notice all of the people looking at
you last week at the park?''

``I did,'' she said. ``Maybe more people than you think share this interest with your
boss.''

``I guess it's possible.'' I said. ``Or maybe they're just sympathetic. Let's head to the
other room and take some pictures.''

She slid off of the table and reached back with her right arm to adjust her underwear at
the back. It was somewhat exciting, watching the way she had to lean and twist to get the casted
arm to her behind.

In the dining room, she posed, as I took pictures. She stood for some, for others she was
seated, and even lying on the table in a few. One pose, standing in front of the fireplace
struck me as extra special, and I took my pad and pencil and sketched her there.

As we headed back to the casting room to cut her free, she stopped suddenly, raised her
arms over her head and started twisting, as though she were reaching for something she couldn't
quite get to.

``What's wrong, Monique?''

``Itch!- on the back of my neck!''

I didn't feel right touching her, but I couldn't let her suffer. I scratched the back of
her neck until she sighed and said thanks.

As I cut her arms out of the cast, she started talking about next Friday.

``Do you have any ideas for what we'll do next week?'' she asked.

``Not yet. I'll have to see if the man in charge has any ideas.''

``What did he think of last week- the park? Do you think he wants us out in public
again?''

``Yes, I'm sure he will,'' I answered.

Monique was glad to hear this. She really had enjoyed all of the stares she'd gotten.
Then, she had an idea.

After I'd finished cutting off Monique's casts, I handed her a cloth to wipe the dust off
of herself. I watched her, noticing the imprint in her skin of the pattern in the stockinette. I
left the room so she could get dressed.

Monique came out after a few minutes, bag over her arm. We said our goodbyes, and planned
to meet again the next Friday at 9:00. We didn't make any specific plans, but I already knew I
wanted to go out in public again.

After she'd gone, I went back into the cast room to clean up. One thing she'd said kept
repeating itself in my mind, and I wondered what it meant: She'd said that maybe more people
share this interest than I thought.

\begin{thought}
As she drove home, Monique kept replaying the day in her mind. The smell of the plaster,
the feel of Quinn's hands, the restriction of the casts. One thing Quinn said over all others
kept going through her mind. He had said ``I think it looks better.'' Not ``the man who pays for
this,'' or ``the boss.'' HE thinks it looks better. She tried not to let her mind go crazy with
the possibilities.

She decided to act on the idea she'd had while Quinn was taking off her casts. She turned
into a drug store parking lot.
\end{thought}
