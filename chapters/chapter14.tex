\chapter{A New Direction}
What to do? I knew I needed something more from casting, but I wasn't sure exactly what that
was. I had taken my last two models outside while casted, and that certainly was pleasing, so
maybe that was a move in the right direction.

Maybe more casts per model, or bigger casts might be the answer. I have always loved body
casts, as well as multiple casts on a woman. The times I have done this have without a doubt
been my favorites. I have always liked the idea of a hip spica and shoulder spica combo, but
that would require getting very close to some very personal areas, and that really might be too
much to ask of a model. A model with all four limbs casted would be nice, too.

Maybe I wanted more realistic settings, such as having a model stay in the wheelchair for
photos and sketch. Perhaps crutches. Or maybe a hospital bed. That thought gave me an idea.

I went to the phone, and called my contact at the medical supply house back east. He said he
could get me the type of bed I wanted, as well as my list of accessories, but that he could not
ship it, as this type of bed was usually only sold to institutions, and not private individuals.

I told him to have it ready in two days, and I would have it picked up. I then called an
interstate mover, and arranged for them to pick it up, and deliver it to me. I claimed I was
helping a relative convalesce after an accident. With the cover story in place, all was in
motion.

I decided to convert the downstairs bedroom that had previously served as my den into a
makeshift hospital room. I spent the next two days moving things out, and painting the room
white, so that it would look correct. My phone hadn't been ringing with new models much lately,
so I wondered if I might be acting a bit hastily. I really liked this little town, but with the
school semester ending, and summer break beginning, I might lose a lot of my potential models. I
decided to try something different to see if I could get things rolling.

I called the office of Kicks, and told them the changes I wanted to make to my ad. The ad
now read: ``Part-time summer modeling work for adventurous women. Full-time pay for one day's
work. No nudity, but an open mind is required. Steady weekly work through the summer.'' My plan
was simple- find two or three models that I could work with on a weekly basis throughout the
summer.

It was finals week, and Monique had been studying hard. It had been difficult, as she had
been spending as much time as she could on the Internet, looking at casting websites. When she
wasn't online, she was looking forward to getting back to the sites. Since she had found the
website that dealt with casting, and those who enjoyed it, she had been strongly drawn to this
dark little corner of cyberspace. After a week of surfing, she felt she had finally made it
through all of the sites.

Most of the sites were mainly pictures (mostly of women) wearing different casts. She
pictured herself wearing many of the casts she saw, imagining what it would feel like to have
the cast applied, and what it would feel like once it was set. She found information about the
casting process, though she already knew quite a bit about it from watching Quinn as he casted
her. She learned a bit of history, how casts as treatments are getting rarer and rarer, and how
fiberglass had almost, but not totally, superceded plaster for the most part.

But, what fascinated her most were the stories, both real and imagined involving casting and
why people were attracted to it. Many people enjoyed wearing the casts for the restriction they
offered. She could relate to that, though she knew that was not her only reason for liking it.
She was fascinated to read that some liked casts for the attention they draw from strangers when
worn in public. The idea of wearing a fake cast in public astounded her. What if she saw someone
she knew? Someone who knew she wasn't really injured. The possibility of getting caught was bad,
but the idea still held allure for her.

Yes, Monique had admitted to herself that she liked wearing the casts she had worn, and she
wanted to wear more. She had even considered ordering some supplies, and casting herself, but
expenses and a roommate made that less than feasible. Besides, (and this was the part she still
had trouble with) she really liked Quinn, and liked when he casted her. The thought of doing it
herself just didn't seem as nice as having it done for her.

That presented a new dilemma in itself: She couldn't approach him to tell him al of this,
yet she wondered if she could go much longer WITHOUT telling him. For the meantime, she would
concentrate as best she could, and maybe calls Quinn next week, after finals were over. Until
then, she would try to sate the desires by examining the photos, and imagining what the casts
must be like. She definitely already had an idea of several things she wanted to try.

Erin had a problem. She needed money to pay the rent, but she wasn't working, and though her
job was waiting for her she couldn't go back for a while. She had a great job at a factory, but
working wasn't possible for several weeks yet, and the rent still came due. If she couldn't come
up with the rent, she'd have to move back home, and that was simply not an option she wanted to
go with. She had left home two years ago after a huge argument with her parents. She just
couldn't live with their rules, and she refused to go to college, as they demanded. Now, her
independence had hit a snag, and was in jeopardy.

She re-read the newspaper ad: ``Full time pay for one day's work.'' That definitely would
work, if they would take her as a model. She decided to call. She had the open mind they asked
for, and if they wanted attractive young women, she should definitely fit their needs. Her
condition would probably exclude her, but if this modeling was from the waist up, she'd be OK.

My phone rang

``Hello?''

``I'm calling about your ad for models. What sort of models do you want, and what exactly
would I be modeling?''

``Well, we're looking for attractive ladies at least 18 years old, and the nature of the
work is best explained in person.''

Erin thought on this one for a bit. She was old enough at 20, yet still young. And she was
sure she was attractive enough.

``Well, I guess we could meet and you could decide if you want to work with me.''

I told her that would be fine. We arranged to meet in an hour, since she was free that day,
and I was working on preparing my ``hospital room.'' I grabbed a quick shower, and waited for
her to arrive. I went into my ``hospital room'' in progress, and admired what was there. The bed
was very cool, with its assortment of traction and other orthopedic attachments. This would be a
very cool backdrop for photos. As I looked things over, there was a knock at the door.

I opened the door to a very beautiful young woman. She was certainly young, 20 at the most,
with long red hair, beautiful blue eyes, and a stunning figure. She wore a black dress with
sheer see through panels around the neck, midsection, and lower skirt. It was clear she had
dressed to impress me, and she had. She had a fantastic tan, especially for a redhead, and I
wondered if the red hair might come from a bottle, as if it mattered. What really floored me
most were her legs. Her left leg was long, wonderfully shaped, and very tan. Her right leg was
in a pink long leg cast!
