Tuesday evening, Detective Cassidy Smith sat at her desk. It was almost time to leave, and
she had all of her paperwork caught up. She was thinking about tomorrow's meeting with Quinn.
She and Johnson had had a meeting with Captain Harmon after she met with Quinn last Wednesday.
Quinn's actions didn't fit with the M.O. of the rapist they thought he might be, but there was
more to this guy than what he let on.

Quinn was rich. He didn't need to ``work'' for a living as he portrayed himself. They had
found accounts in his name totaling more than ten million dollars. They had discovered that he
had come into the money through inheritance and smart investment, so there wasn't any evidence
of any crime there. The general nature of what he was doing made the captain nervous. She and
Johnson had a light case load these days, so the captain wanted to continue to find out more
about the guy. She wasn't sure why they didn't just reveal themselves and question the guy, but
the Captain wanted to continue undercover, so she would do as he asked.

Cassidy had done a search for any unsolved crimes involving a perpetrator that put women
in casts. The search, of course, had come back negative.

So, she prepared herself for the next day's meeting, looking over ``Sam's'' profile, and
thinking of questions she could ask to find out more, but not seeming too inquisitive.

Wednesday morning, I got up, showered and began getting ready for Samantha to arrive. Our
first session had been good, but we'd only done a single short leg cast- it was time to go
bigger, and today was the day. She had looked a little uncomfortable last week. I was
considering that she might not be cut out for this, hoping that I was wrong. Samantha was
beautiful, and I was looking forward to some daring cast combinations with her. There are
several casts and combos that I still have not done that I really want to. I really hope
Samantha can figure into these plans.

I heard a squeak of brakes from out in front of the house, and looked through the window to
see Samantha getting out of her red Toyota. She looked great in a black shell top, white shorts,
and tennis shoes.

I let her in, and greeted her.

``Hello, Samantha. Thanks for coming back.''

``Hi, Quinn. What's the plan for today?''

``Today, we'll do both legs, if you're up to it.''

``Sure.'' She answered. Cassidy thought about how she'd really be compromised. Moving
around quickly in a crisis with both legs in casts up to the knee would be impossible. She
didn't like it, but at least she had Johnson and two other guys close, just waiting to move in
if she said the word.

I headed slightly toward the kitchen. ``Samantha, I'm going to get something to drink. Do
you want anything?''

``No, I'm fine. I don't want to have to run to the bathroom if I can't even walk.'' She
said, thinking to herself what a smooth answer that was. Offering her a drink immediately this
time was different. It may not mean anything, but it could mean everything.

``Ok, I'll be right back.'' I told her.

While he was gone, Cass looked around the room. She walked in the direction of the room
where she'd had her cast put on last week. There was another door slightly ajar. She peeked
inside, and saw a hospital bed. There was a frame over the bed, and there were a couple of what
appeared to be slings hanging from the frame. They didn't look like any sort of restraint, but
she supposed they could be used that way. She heard footsteps and turned as Quinn returned to
the room.

``That is interesting.'' She said. ``Is that for me?''

``Not today.'' I answered. ``We'll probably use that sooner or later. It's basically a
small
hospital room. The man in charge likes for some of the pictures and drawings to be set in a
hospital type setting, so I set up that room.''

``I see. It looks like some elaborate bondage contraption.''

``I guess it does, but a lot of genuine orthopedic treatments do look that way,'' I said
as
I popped the top on my soda. ``If you're ready, we can get started.''

In the cast room, she opened her bag, and showed me the clothing she'd brought. I picked
out what I liked, grabbed my bucket and left her to change.

When Quinn was gone, Cassidy heard the familiar voice of Johnson in her ear. ``Cass, we're
reading everything loud and clear. Tap twice on the mike of you're hearing me OK. She tapped
twice on the concealed microphone in her bag. ``OK, if you need us we're in the house in ten
seconds.'' Cass went back to changing.

I knocked lightly on the door before I went back in. When I opened the door, Samantha was
sitting on the cast table in the red bra and underwear I had chosen. She really looked awesome,
sitting there with her hands on the table beside her. I set the bucket down on the cart next to
the plaster rolls I had already laid out.

``If you're ready, we can go ahead and get started,'' I said, pulling on a pair of gloves.

``I'm ready.'' She said.

I cut off a length of four inch stockinette, and slid it up her left leg to just past the
knee. I then took a roll of four inch wide padding, and started wrapping her leg at the knee,
working down. While I was doing this, Samantha started asking me questions.

``So, how big is this â€˜fetish'? Are there a lot of people into this?''

``I don't know for sure. I know there are some, but I really don't know how many.''

As I started dipping and wrapping the plaster rolls on her leg, she continued with the
questions.

``Do you think there are people who actually hurt other people, so that they HAVE to wear
the casts?''

That irritated me a bit, but I kept my cool. ``Well, this really isn't my fetish,'' I told
her. ``I'm just an employee, too. I have had some contact with other people who DO enjoy this,
and none of them seemed to be that type. In fact, most of them feel guilt that they enjoy seeing
casts when they're used to treat real injuries.''

Cass noted that he was continuing in the lie that he was ``just an employee.'' She
wondered
how much of what he told her was truth, but she did get the feeling that he was one of the ones
he mentioned as feeling guilt. She really didn't think this guy was up to anything illegal,
weird as it was.

``This one is different than the one we did last week. It looks like it is messier,'' she
said.

``We're making this cast out of plaster. The one we did last week was fiberglass.''

``What's the difference?''

``Well, they're entirely different materials,'' I said, glad that she'd changed the
direction of the conversation. I explained to her that plaster was smoother, took longer to dry,
and was used for many years before fiberglass came along in the 1970's and became the preferred
method of making casts. I told her that my ``boss'' liked to see both types used. By the time I
was finished explaining it to her, I had turned down the ends of the padding and stockinette and
anchored them with a final roll of plaster. I slid the padded stand under her leg, and set her
leg gently on it. I smoothed the plaster out before I pulled off my gloves and tossed them into
the trash.

``So, how many other models do you work with regularly?'' Samantha asked.

``I have two others that I work with on a weekly basis,'' I answered as I cut off another
piece of four inch stockinette and slid it up her leg to high on the thigh.

``Oh!'' she said. ``This one is going to be bigger?''

``Yes, if you're OK with it.''

``Sure, it's fine.'' She answered, while thinking to herself that she was really going to
be immobile. She was glad she didn't feel that this guy was a threat. She returned to her
questions.

``Who are the other girls you work with? I may know them.''

``Samantha, I don't feel comfortable giving out their names. I hope you can understand
why.
I wouldn't give out your name, either.''

``Yes, I understand.'' She said, thinking to herself that if they wanted to question any
of
his other models, they could just watch the house to find out who they were. ``And I'm glad that
you wouldn't give out my name, either.''

I continued wrapping the padding on her leg, as she asked ``I wonder if there are women
who
do this that actually like it.''

``There are some,'' I answered, ``But not many. There are also some who just do it to
please
their boyfriends or husbands. I would imagine there are some who like it just for the attention
it gets them.''

I had started wrapping the plaster on her leg when she said ``So, you're setting me up to
look like I have a broken ankle and a broken leg?''

``Yes.''

``Do people like stories made up about the women who wear these? I mean, do you make up
stories about how they got hurt, even when they're not really hurt?''

The only time I make up fake stories is when I have a model out in public in a cast, and
that's just a cover story if someone asks.'' I noticed that she was squirming a bit with her
left leg. ``Try not to move that leg, the plaster is still setting.''

``It's pretty warm,'' she responded.

``Sorry about that. It does get a bit hot as it sets. It won't burn you, though.''

``I was starting to worry.''

I finished wrapping the plaster on her right leg, and smoothed it out. I set the leg on
the other stand, and after I'd tossed the gloves, I got a fan and set it to blow on the casts
while they dried. I changed the subject to her studies, as I was getting a bit uncomfortable
with her questions, and we talked for a short while as the casts set up.

When the casts were fairly well set, I picked her up and placed her in the wheelchair. I
took her out to the living room, and took several photos of her in the chair. I picked her up,
and set her on the couch, where she posed for more pictures. While she was there, I got out the
pad and my pencil, and sketched her. When it was done, I showed her the drawing.


``That's very good work. You are very talented,'' she said.

``Thanks. Are you ready to get out of those?''

``Yes.''

I took her back to the casting room, and cut the casts off of her, using the same style I
always did. She dressed herself, and before she left, I agreed to call her later in the week
about working again next week. I took the casts downstairs, and placed them with the rest of the
casts I'd put on my models. The collection was getting rather large. It was getting to the point
where it took some thought to remember which casts were worn by whom. I needed to get rid of
them, but I couldn't bring myself to do it. For the meantime, I decided to catalog them, so I
could remember who had worn what.

As I went through the casts, I remembered each of the women who'd worn them, and how
they'd looked with them on. I had to count the collection up: There were a total of 9 long leg
casts, 4 short leg casts, 6 long arm casts, 2 short arm thumb spicas, 2 body casts, and one
shoulder spica. That was quite a collection, but there are casts that I have not yet done, that
I want to do. I made a mental list of these as I went back upstairs.
