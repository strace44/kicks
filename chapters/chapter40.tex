\chapter{}
Just after lunch on Wednesday, the knock at the door I'd been waiting for came.

``Hello, sir. We have your Ovation orthopedic table, and I understand we'll be taking an
exam table back with us?'' The patch on his shirt identified him as an employee of the medical
supply house that I get everything from. Their delivery truck was by the curb in front of the
house, and another worker was opening the back of the truck.

Their timing couldn't have been better. Monique had left for work a couple of hours before,
and I wouldn't be seeing her for another six hours, at the soonest. She didn't know about this,
I hadn't told her so that I could surprise her. I'd placed this order three weeks ago, before
our trip to Indianapolis.

``Great!'' I said. ``I assume you want to start by taking out the table that's already in
there?''

``Yes, where is it?'' He asked. His partner had retrieved a heavy duty hand cart and small
toolbox from the back of the truck, and by this time, had joined him on the porch.

``This way, gentlemen.'' I led them to the casting room. They quickly set in to the exam
table that had served as my casting table until today. It had been a great table for applying
casts to arms or legs, but for larger casts and multiple casts, it had quickly revealed its'
shortcomings. I'd spent the morning cleaning it up, and now they were disassembling it into the
three sub assemblies that made it easier to move. They were very careful not to bang doorframes
as they wheeled it out and loaded it up into the truck.

Then they started unloading the new table. I must admit to being anxious to check it out. I
was more anxious to put it to use, but that would have to wait until Friday morning.

They brought in several large boxes, and several metal parts wrapped in plastic. They
quickly assembled the base, and slid the leg spars into the steel tubes that held them, but
allowed them to be adjusted in relation to the main upright. Next, they assembled the center
support. They finished by assembling the small equipment cart that held all of the various
attachments for the table, and them started removing the various attachments from boxes and
putting them into their designated places on the cart. They finished by bringing in four more
spars. These were part of a modification that I had requested. This is why it took three weeks
to get the table. But, with this modification, this was the perfect casting table for
recreational casting.

When they had finished with the table, one of them went back to the truck to get the other
items I had ordered: more plaster and padding to replenish stock and a casting cart that had
bins on the open sides for holding rolls of plaster and fiberglass. It also had it's own
stainless steel pail on top that fit into an indentation to keep it from sliding off easily.
While he got these items, the other delivery man gave me the manual for the table and had me
sign the invoice.

I tipped the delivery men, and was soon alone with the new toy. Most of the attachments
were obvious, but I needed the manual to identify some of them, as well as how to use them. I
assembled several of the attachments to the table, and tried out several of the adjusting
features. It was soon obvious that this was going to meet or exceed every expectation I'd had
for it. This would enable me to build any cast I wanted on Monique in a medically sound way and
without the strain that making some of the larger casts had caused to one or both of us. It was
going to make things even more fun.

\begin{thought}
Monique couldn't wait until Friday. All week long, she'd been anticipating the casting
adventure they'd planned for the weekend. She'd been thinking of how the cast would feel as it
was applied, and how the restriction would feel once it was on and set. She was also eagerly
looking forward to seeing the reactions of people to her in such a big cast when they went out
in public. She'd put a lot of thought in how she wanted to dress when they went out. She wanted
it to be obvious to anyone who saw her that she was in a really big cast. She had purchased a
skirt that fastened by tying at the side. It was two sizes to big so that it would fit her over
the cast. She would wear it with a tight top that would clearly define the upper edge of the
cast. She'd also purchased some underwear that tied at the sides and was oversized. This was her
final weekend before school started up for the fall semester, and she was planning to enjoy this
last weekend before the stresses of school started back up for the year.
\end{thought}

I was still alternating between reading the manual and trying out different attachments and
adjustments on the table when I was startled by the sound of the back door opening and someone
coming inside. It was then that I noticed the fading light in the window and realized that I'd
totally lost track of time while exploring the features of the new table. The person coming in
was Monique, returning from work. I quickly hurried out of the casting room just in time to meet
her before she could have seen the new equipment. I didn't want her to see it until Friday. I
wanted it to be a surprise.

She smiled when she saw me, and we embraced and kissed.

``What were you up to in there?'' She asked.

``Nothing'' I said with a smile that told her it was anything but nothing.

``Yeah, right. What were you doing?''

``I was just making some preparations for Friday, if you still want to go through with our
plans.'' I said.

``Are you kidding? I'm really looking forward to it!'' she said, as she reached past me for
the doorknob. I stopped her hand, and she gave me a look that suggested bewilderment and a
slight bit of hurt.

``I have a surprise for you, but I'd like to save it for Friday. I'm pretty sure it is
something you will like. Do you trust me?''

``Well, of course I do. But now, I'm really curious as to what you're up to.'' She replied.
``Do you know how hard it will be for me to not peek?''

``Yes, but you'll be pleased come Friday, and now you get to spend all of tomorrow trying to
figure out what I've done.''

``Like I'm not anxious enough for Friday already,'' she said. ``But if you want it to be a
surprise, I promise not to peek.''

``Thank you. You do know you're terrific, don't you?'' I asked, and we embraced and kissed
again.

Friday morning, we got up early. Actually Monique got up early and then she woke me up. We
had a light breakfast, and she went for a morning run. She wanted to get a bit of exercise
before starting into a sedentary weekend. While she was gone, I assembled the necessary table
attachments and laid out stockinette in twelve and four inch widths, padding in four and six
inch widths, and plaster bandages in four and six inch widths. I also got out a broom handle and
the saw I would need to cut it.

When she returned from jogging, she wanted to take a quick shower. I instructed her to
knock on the door before coming in.

``Okay, but I won't be long. I don't know what I'm looking forward to most, the cast or
seeing what you've cooked up in there''

``Take a nice long shower.'' I told her. ``Remember that once we get started, you'll be
helpless and under my care. You won't get another chance to shower until Sunday night.''

``Yeah, yeah. I'll see you in about ten minutes.'' She said, kissing me and turning to go
upstairs.

While she was gone, I drew a pail of tepid water and took it to the cast room. I moved the
trash can close to the table so it would be ready to receive the many wrappers from the plaster
rolls. Since she was still upstairs, I went to the parlor to have a smoke while I waited for
her.

\begin{thought}
Monique enjoyed the feel of the hot water washing the sweat from her naked body. Of course,
she was anticipating the cast application. She wasn't sure exactly how they would apply it, but
she assumed that he would apply the cast with her in the standing position. He would probably
start at the top and work down, and when it was mostly set, he would help her onto the table
where he would finish her feet. She forced herself to stay a little longer than she actually
wanted. She willed herself to relax and enjoy the feelings of the shower and not focus on her
impatient need to go find out what the surprise was and get started on the cast. She thought
briefly about washing her hair, but decided that she didn't want to take the time to dry it
before getting started. Besides, Quinn would wash it for her if she asked, and it was wonderful
to be spoiled like that.

She finished the shower and dried herself. She stepped out and let the air caress her nude
body, thinking to herself that most of her body would soon be sealed away from the air for a
couple of days. After a few minutes, she put on a long t shirt that came down to mid-thigh and
got one of the pairs of oversized underwear she'd bought and went downstairs and found Quinn
sitting in the parlor.
\end{thought}

When Monique came downstairs, I stood up and went to her. I hugged her and then pulled out
the silk scarf I'd put in my pocket. I smiled at her, then without a word, I tied it around her
eyes as a blindfold.

``Wow, you're really doing this surprise up big!'' she said.

``I hope you're going to like this.'' I said as I led her through the casting room, and
opened the door.

Once inside, I started in on my little speech:

``Monique, you are truly amazing. I love it that you love wearing casts as much as love
seeing you wear them. I want our casting adventures to be as enjoyable as possible, so I got us
something to make things better.'' I reached up and pulled the blindfold off.

Her eyes got big as she saw the table.

``Wow.'' She said quietly. That's an actual medical casting table, isn't it?''

\begin{thought}
``This is cool!'' she thought to herself. ``This will make it easier on both of us when we do
bigger casts!''
\end{thought}

``Yes, but with a couple of modifications,'' I said. ``I had them add a couple of features so
that it will accommodate any cast we want to do. With this we can put you in any cast or
combination of casts and you'll be able to totally relax while I build the cast.''

I began to show her the various attachments and how they worked, and what types of casting
they would facilitate. She didn't let me go very far before she said. ``Don't tell me how they
work, show me!''

``Well then, if you're ready, we can begin''

She answered me by slipping the t shirt off and putting it and the underwear on the chair
by the door. I smiled at her standing there, her beautiful nude skin still slightly red from the
hot shower she'd just taken.

``If the patient will have a seat, we'll get started,'' I said tapping the padded board of
the center support.

Monique sat sideways on the main support while I cut a piece of the twelve inch stockinette
into a manageable length. I cut it longer than needed, but I would trim it up as needed. I
approached her with the stockinette, and she raised her arms. I slipped it over her head and
pulled it down to her hips, leaving it a bit bunched up. I would smooth it out later. I
instructed her to lie down and when she had, I helped her to slide down until the perineal post
was in place under her buttocks. It had a very narrow support that was barely wide enough to
support her at the pelvis. Being narrow, I would be able to cast around it, and slide it out
once the cast was finished. Once she was in position, I raised the center support until she
would be at a height where it would be more comfortable for me to apply the cast.

I had already attached the foot plates to the leg spars. One at a time, I released the
locking clamps on the spars and slid them toward her until her feet reached the plates, then
fastened her feet into the bootlike footplates with the padded Velcro straps.

We had discussed the different positions of hip spica casts during the planning stages of
the adventure. A cast in the seated position is nicer for being in a wheelchair, but lying flat
is more medically accurate. We'd decided that a compromise would be best for us. We'd put a
slight bend in the hips and knees, which would make the publicking easier, but still be
medically believable. I raised the leg spars until her hips and knees were bent at about a
thirty degree angle, and then moved them to the sides to spread her legs enough to look
medically believable. Once I had her legs where I wanted them, I checked to make sure everything
felt comfortable to her, then locked the leg supports at all of their points of adjustment.

The last thing to set into place was the center support board. I unlocked the lever that
held it in place then stepped around the head of the table and slid it back until it supported
her head and shoulders only. I locked it into place and she was now ready to be casted: Her body
was exposed top and bottom from the shoulder blades down, with supports at her buttocks and
feet.

``How does this feel?'' I asked her. Are you comfortable or straining against it anywhere?''

``No,'' she answered. ``It's great. I'm totally relaxed.''

``Are you sure? This is the position you're going to be casted in.''

``I'm fine, really.'' She said. ``Does this work for you?''

``Monique, I can't be sure until I start, but I think this is going to be much easier than
any large cast we've ever done. You're very accessible to me, and I won't be worried about your
comfort or you holding a position while I cast you. I'm expecting to enjoy this more than any
other large cast I've ever done.''

``Let's find out, then!'' she said.

I set in to work. I cut two lengths of four inch stockinette about five feet long. I
unclamped her left leg, and slid the four inch section up her leg to her hip and smoothed it
out. I put her foot back into the padded footplate, then repeated the process for her right leg.
I took a small cloth and covered her private area to protect it from plaster drips, and then
pulled the twelve inch stockinette down to past her hips, then pulled it up past her breasts and
left the extra bunched at the top. Next, I took a roll of six inch padding and covered her
hipbones in straight strips, tearing it off when each strip was done. This would give the hip
bones a couple of extra thicknesses of padding. I followed by wrapping her from her ribs to her
knees in six inch padding. I covered her thoroughly, not worrying about the areas that needed to
be exposed later. My main goal at this point was to get her sufficiently padded and to have the
padding smooth. I then took four inch padding and wrapped each leg from just above the knee to
the ankle.

I began tearing open rolls of twelve inch plaster, laying them on the cart. The cart would
be very helpful today as I moved from one side of Monique to the other. Monique interrupted my
preparations.

``You're not going to cast my feet?'' she asked with a concerned look on her face.

``I will, but that will be the last thing we do. This table has all sorts of great
attachments,'' I reassured her. ``When we get there, you'll see.''

I dipped the first roll of plaster and began.

\begin{thought}
The anticipation was over! She was warm and snug from her ribs down in this soft white
cocoon. She raised her arms above her head for a couple of reasons: it would get them out of
Quinn's way, and she could also use them to prop up her head so she could see him working.

She watched as one by one, he unrolled four of the wide plaster bandages and folded them
over themselves in lengths about two feet long. From experience, she knew he was making splints
that would go on first to make the cast stronger. He dipped the first one and laid it on her
right side from mid thigh to nearly her waist. He then stepped across and repeated the process
on the left side. She could feel the weight of the plaster lying on her, a familiar feeling that
hadn't lost a bit of its pleasure. ``Always something special about the first roll,'' she
thought
to herself.
\end{thought}

I dipped the third splint and wrung it out and put one end of it in place high on the
underside of her left thigh. I held it there with my left hand while I took a fresh roll of six
inch plaster with my right hand. I slid a finger under the end of the roll before dipping it so
that I could get the end free from the roll with one hand. I dipped it, gave it a squeeze and
began wrapping her left thigh. I wasn't trying to build thickness at this point, just trying to
hold the splints in place. I worked my way up her thigh and over her hip, and finished the roll
just past her waist. I rolled the cart back to her right side and repeated this process.

When I'd finished, I went ahead and started molding the cast over her hip bones. If I mold
it carefully from the start, she'll be comfortable, but the movement inside the cast will be
almost completely eliminated. Besides, molding a cast is very enjoyable to me- the plaster is
smooth and creamy under my hands, and the cast is setting, but still flexible. These feelings,
combined with the fact that the cast follows Monique's wonderful curves make it quite the treat
for the sense of touch.

\begin{thought}
As Quinn started forming the wet plaster down around her hip bones, Monique was in ecstasy.
The weight of the plaster and the feel of his hands were dulled by the padding she was wrapped
in, but the sensations were wonderful to her. She watched as Quinn continued, He began rolling
wide plaster bandages on her thighs and hips, smoothing and forming each one as he finished
wrapping it. The heat of setting was just starting to come through the padding in the areas
where the splints had been laid.
\end{thought}

I continued building the cast, building thickness in her hips, which would be the weakest
area. I made sure to massage the rolls in well. This would not only give us a very smooth cast,
but get each layer to laminate well with the layers above and below it. As I worked, I was
bringing the cast higher up her midsection and lower down her thighs.

Satisfied with the solid base I'd laid, I trimmed back the padding at the top just a couple
of inches from the top of the plaster. I folded the stockinette and padding over and smoothed it
out, working some of the wet plaster into the stretchy white material. I took another roll and
anchored the stockinette and wrapped downward, massaging the plaster carefully as I wrapped. It
was always pleasing to see the plaster go from the rough texture when it was first wrapped to
the smooth dull look it took once smoothed.

I then set in on finishing the opening between her legs, which I expected to be the
trickiest part of the cast. I was correct in this expectation. I took a pair of heavy scissors
and trimmed the setting plaster to shape at the edges. I cut a slit in the padding from front to
back, and once the stockinette was exposed, a few well placed cuts enabled me to fold it back.
The stockinette from her legs formed the edge at the top of each leg, and the body stockinette
formed the top edges of the opening front and back. I had to squat down to get to the lower side
of the opening, and it was a bit tricky, but I was able to get it anchored.

\begin{thought}
As Quinn put the finishing touches on the opening between her legs, Monique clenched her
fists under her head. She wasn't doing it in pain. In fact, it was anything BUT pain. His touch,
and the incidental contact on her most sensitive areas was driving her nearly insane, and she
clenched her fists to quell her urge to writhe against the cast.

She'd expected this cast to be wonderful. She'd expected the application process to be very
sensual, and she was now realizing that she'd underestimated it greatly.
\end{thought}

As I finished the final smoothing of the cast over her hips and around the opening, I
noticed that Monique appeared to be in some sort of discomfort.

``What's wrong?'' I asked.

``Nothing,'' She said. ``Not one damned thing. What you're doing feels really good, and you're
driving me crazy!'' She smiled at me, and I noticed she had droplets of perspiration on her
brow.

I kissed her passionately, and she wrapped her arms around me as best she could.

``We have to wait,'' I told her. ``But I plan on making you a lot crazier while you're in this
cast.'' She smiled back, and I returned the smile before going back to work.

As I started wrapping plaster on her legs from her thighs down to her ankles, I noticed
that while I was sweating a bit, I wasn't straining as I had while making some of the other
large casts. This table was making it MUCH easier to build this cast.

I stepped away from her and got the broom handle. I laid it across the top of her legs and
judged the length I'd need. I took the saw and cut it to length. I dipped a four inch roll and
anchored it to her left leg, wrapping with my right hand while holding the bar with my left. I
quickly moved to the other side and repeated the process. I continued to cover the bar and build
the cast over her lower legs, smoothing it out as I went.

The cast needed to set up a bit more before releasing her feet, so I excused myself to the
kitchen and returned with sodas. I made sure to bring a flexible straw for Monique.

Returning to the room, I noticed the smell of the drying plaster. It had been there all
along, but I'd been too busy to notice it. While we waited, we drank our drinks and had a smoke.

``How does it feel so far?'' I asked her.

``It feels outstanding,'' she said. ``It's getting really warm, and it's making me really
hot.'' She added.

\begin{thought}
It was making her very hot, indeed. She'd had several different types of casts before.
She'd had the luxury of having them without injury, so she'd been able to concentrate on the
application without pain. She'd anticipated this cast, how it would feel being applied, and how
it would feel as it set. Still, she realized that it was even more intense than she'd expected
it to be.

She'd expected a lot from this cast. And she was learning that she'd underestimated how
great it would be. This was, with no doubts, her best experience being casted thus far.
\end{thought}

Monique had drifted off in thought. I pulled her back.

``Hey- are you in there?''

``Yes,'' she answered. ``I'm just really enjoying this. I expected it to be good, but I never
thought I'd like it this much!''

``I hope you're having as much fun with the inside of this cast as I'm having with the
outside,'' I told her.

``I doubt you can be enjoying the outside as much as I'm enjoying the inside.'' I bent down
to give her a quick kiss, but she wrapped an arm around my head and held me there for a good
while. I didn't complain.

``Are you ready to finish?'' Your feet are kind of naked.

She nodded, and I got back to work. I pulled the equipment cart over, and selected one of
the tibial support uprights. I slid it into the socket on the foot spar on the right side and
moved it into place under her calf and locked it into place. I then released the straps holding
her foot and removed the foot plate.

After repeating the process on the left side, I wrapped each foot in four inch padding,
followed by four inch plaster. My biggest concern was getting the fresh plaster to laminate well
with what was already there, so I wiped the existing plaster down with a wet cloth to help.
Between that, working it up as high as I could before the supports were in my way and thorough
massaging and smoothing, I was confident that it would be strong enough.

My last duty before I could call this cast complete was to take a wet cloth and rub it over
the surface of the plaster to buff it out as smooth as possible. Ideally, when finished, the
cast would be dead smooth, showing no folds, wrinkles, rough spots, or bandage ends.

When I had finished, it wasn't perfect, but it was very close. There were a few places
where the edges of the plaster bandages showed, and a couple of places where the porous cloth
could be seen on the surface. Still, I was very pleased with the result. I checked the clock,
and was amazed to find that it had taken an hour and a half to apply the cast. The table had
made it much easier, but it had still been quite a tiring job.

I pulled up a chair near the head of the table and sat with Monique for a few minutes, just
relaxing. I wanted to leave her held by the table for a few hours before moving her, so I
decided to do a sketch of her.

\begin{thought}
Here we are. We did it. A double hip spica. She was already enjoying this experience, but
the next two days promised to be even better.

As she watched Quinn working over the paper with his pencil, she took inventory of the
sensations the cast was giving her: While the plaster was very warm around her feet and lower
legs, it had already cooled around her hips and waist. She didn't put much strength into trying,
but a few small attempts at movement had shown very little room inside the cast. She loved how
the cast held so much of her so snugly. It wasn't tight, but she could feel every inch of it
around her.

She continued to watch Quinn work, imagining what the next two days would hold.
\end{thought}
