\chapter{}
Friday afternoon, Monique's last class ended at 2:30 p.m. As we headed for the truck, a few
friends wanted to stop and chat with her, but she excused herself quickly, saying that we had to
get to a doctor's appointment. They wished her well as we left, hoping she'd get good news.

We had a busy weekend ahead of us, and we were both excited and nervous. We'd pulled off a
week of convincing people that Monique was badly injured, and being treated in a way that was
rarely, if ever, used any more. We'd even convinced some of her classmates who were studying for
careers in medicine. We were hoping the new cast next week wouldn't hurt our charade, but it was
a chance we had to take.

\begin{thought}
Monique was going to miss this cast. She realized she'd be getting a similar one in just
two days, but she had really enjoyed this past week. She'd worn casts before, but never for more
than a couple of days. She'd played the part of ``the poor girl in the cast'' before, but never
for people that she knew. This whole week had been a serious escalation of recreational casting
for her. And she had to admit that she'd loved nearly every minute of it. This cast, a random
meeting with people she knew, and some quick thinking had set the stage. The new cast would be
lighter and better positioned for daily life, but this one was special- it had made the whole
thing possible. She knew it had to come off for the weekend; there was no way to avoid it. She
knew she had to exercise and try not to lose too much muscle tone.

It was also time for the cast to go for another reason: It was starting to smell. It wasn't
overpowering, but it wasn't a good smell, either.
\end{thought}

``Are you anxious to be out?'' I asked.

``Yes and no,'' she replied. ``I love this cast. It's been my favorite one that I've worn so
far, by a huge margin. I'll be sad to see it go, but I'll be glad to be able to take a long, hot
bath. And it will be great to make love properly again.'' She added with a sexy smile.

I smiled back as we turned into the driveway.

Once we were inside, I took her straight to the casting room. I undressed her and helped
her use the restroom, and then I picked her up and placed her on the casting table. Everything
was still adjusted the way it was when I'd put the cast on her, so the attachments were still in
the perfect position to support her. I placed a cloth over the opening between her legs to help
protect from dust. I retrieved the cast saw from the cabinet and plugged it in.

``Are you ready?''

She nodded, and I turned the saw on. I began slicing through the plaster at her ribs on the
right side, working my way toward her hip and on down her leg.

\begin{thought}
Monique had to stifle giggles as the vibration of the saw tickled her. Being cut out of
this cast was going to be different than all of the previous ones: every time before, she'd only
been immobilized for a couple of days, and usually less. There was never any anticipation as to
how stiff she'd be or how painful moving would be. She realized she was probably too worried
about it- she'd only been in the cast for a week, and she'd been doing isometric exercises
several times a day.
\end{thought}

When I'd completed the cut all the way down her right side, I moved to the other side of
the table and repeated the cut on her left side. I then moved to the inside of her legs, cutting
first the left, then the right from the toes to the opening at the top of her thighs. I made
jogs in the cuts around the spreader bar, leaving it attached to the bottom part of the cast.

\begin{thought}
As he cut through the cast on the inside of her thighs, the tickling was replaced with a
different sensation. This was a much nicer feeling.
\end{thought}

I took my cast spreaders, and began working along the cuts I'd made, prying the halves of
the cast apart far enough to allow me to cut the padding and stockinette. When it was all done,
I paused.

``Here we go,'' I said. ``Don't try to move right away, let's work you into it slowly.'' I told
her.

She nodded, and I pulled the top half of the cast off of her and set it aside.

\begin{thought}
Monique gasped as the cool air hit her body with a chill. It wasn't cold in the room, but
having been sealed away for so long, the air felt frigid on her newly exposed skin.
\end{thought}

``Are you okay?'' I asked.

``Yes, it's just cold,'' she answered.

There was no way to avoid what had to come next. I was dreading discovering how stiff and
weak she would be, but it had to be done, and it couldn't wait any longer.

``Okay, let's see how bad this is,'' I started. ``Try and touch your left knee to your chest.''

\begin{thought}
Monique steeled herself and lifted her leg. Her hip and knee ached with the movement, but
much less than she feared. She reached up with her arms and pulled her knee the rest of the way
to her chest. The last little bit of movement hurt enough for her to wince, but she made it.
\end{thought}

I was pleased. ``Try the right.''

She repeated the movement with the other leg. I was pleased at how much range of movement
she had without assistance, and also pleased that bringing the knee fully to her chest wasn't
excruciatingly painful.

``I expected this to be worse,'' she said.

``As did I,'' I responded. ``Let's get you into the tub for a soak. It will be good for you.''
I put one arm under her knees, and the other under her back and lifted her up out of the cast.

``Hey, you don't weigh a ton anymore,'' I joked as I set her down in the chair.

``Thanks,'' she said with more than a little sarcasm.

We decided to get her the hot bath she'd been wanting. I offered to carry her upstairs, but
she wanted to try walking. I helped her up, and she just stood there for a few minutes before
taking the first steps. She was wobbly, and I stuck close to her. She leaned on me a little bit,
walking around the lower level of the house, getting used to walking again. When she was ready,
I helped her up the stairs. She was still unsteady, and she used the banister and me for
support, but she made it up and into the bath. I left her with the instructions to stay there as
long as she wanted.

\begin{thought}
The hot water was working. Monique could feel her legs loosening up as she sat in the hot
water, Her joints had stabbed at her a bit as she lowered herself into the hot water, but soon,
they began to relax.
\end{thought}

Monique spent the better part on an hour in the tub, while I cleaned up the casting room. I
took the removed cast downstairs and put it with the collection, then returned and cleaned the
layer of white dust from the floor. Once that was finished, I started laying out supplies for
putting the new cast on her on Sunday.

When she'd finished, we had dinner, and then watched television before bed. Every 15
minutes, Monique would do some sort of static exercise, such as deep knee bends or leg lifts.
When we went to bed, she certainly did not appear to be feeling any ill effects from a week of
immobilization.

Saturday, I left mid-morning, and went to a local sporting goods store. I purchased an
elliptical machine and a rowing machine. I had them assembled by mid afternoon, and Monique used
them the rest of the day, periodically.

Sunday, we left early and went for a drive. We didn't stop anywhere for very long for fear
of running into someone Monique knew. The trip itself was risky, but getting out together felt
good. We returned home late afternoon, and Monique went to take a shower while I made the final
preparations in the casting room.

\begin{thought}
Monique dried herself off after her shower, wrapped herself in the towel, and headed
downstairs. Before heading to the casting room, she grabbed a tank top and some underwear with
side ties.

Quinn was ready for her when she entered. He had stockinette ready. She took off the towel,
and raised her left foot off the floor. Quinn bent down and slid a piece of 4'' stockinette all
the way up her leg to her hip, leaving extra bunched around her ankle. She raised her right foot
and he repeated the process for the other leg. He then took a piece of 12'' stockinette and she
raised her arms so he could slide it over her body from her breasts to past her hips.
\end{thought}

``If you're ready, hop on up and we'll get started.'' He said.

\begin{thought}
Monique sat on the table, and scooted down until her butt was on the support post. Quinn
adjusted the leg supports to position her legs. When her legs were splayed at an angle of about
45 degrees, and her hips were bent almost to 90 degrees, he straightened out the wrinkles in the
stockinette, and pulled the bunched areas around her ankles down to past her toes.

He took a roll of 6 inch wide padding and unrolled a section about two and a half feet
long, tore it off, and laid it over her left hipbone from thigh to waist. He did this two more
times, and then repeated the process for the right side, which finished the roll. He took
another roll and wrapped from her breasts to her right thigh, then another roll went from her
breasts to her left thigh. He then wrapped each leg, starting at the toes with four inch wide
padding, working upward and moving to six inch when the first roll ran out. When each leg had
been thoroughly padded, and some more had been added around the hips, He stopped for a break.

They each had a cigarette as they relaxed for a few minutes before the casting began.
Monique loved the feel of the stockinette against her skin, coupled with the slight pressure and
warmth of the padding. As they smoked, Quinn discussed the casting process they were about to
undertake.
\end{thought}

``I'm going to do the fiberglass splints and the first rolls on your hips without soaking
the fiberglass.'' He said

``Does that work?'' Monique asked.

``Yes, it does. The dampness from the wet rolls that go over it will cause it to kick off
just fine. In fact, we could do the whole cast dry, and the moisture in the air would actually
start the reaction.''

``Quinn, we never discussed what color to do this cast in.'' She said

``I assumed you'd want white. Did you have something else in mind?''

``Do we have enough purple?'' she asked.

``I think so,'' he said, heading to a cabinet and opening it. He removed two boxes of
fiberglass. ``Yes, I have a box of four inch and a box of five inch in purple. It's not enough
to
do the whole cast, but if I use white for the base, then finish with purple, we'll be fine.''

``Good.'' She said as she stubbed out her smoke and laid back down, ready to begin. Quinn
butted his, and pulled on rubber gloves.

\begin{thought}
Monique watched as Quinn opened a roll of five inch white fiber. He unrolled it a few feet,
folded it over, and repeated the process until the entire roll was used. He laid the splint on
her right thigh and hip, from waist to mid-thigh. The fruity smell of the fiberglass filled her
nose, and feeling the weight of the fiberglass through the padding made Monique flush with
excitement.

He unwrapped another roll, and wrapped her from just below her breasts, over her hips, and
down her thigh, anchoring the splint. He repeated this process three more times, placing and
anchoring splints to the front of the other hip, and to the back of each. He was careful to keep
the fiber smooth and free from wrinkles as he wrapped. He then took rolls of four inch
fiberglass and wrapped each leg from the toes. These rolls he dipped in water. He worked up each
leg until he had overlapped the fiber that he had already wrapped from the top. She was feeling
warmth from not only her lower legs, but also from her hips as the moisture caused the chemical
reaction to begin.

At this point, Quinn took a quick measurement, and then cut a broom handle to the distance
between her calves. He then took out the first roll of four inch purple fiber, folded over the
padding and stockinette at her left toes, then dipped the roll. He began wrapping at her foot,
anchoring the stockinette and padding. He had to cover the white fiberglass with two layers of
purple to get the deep color to show true. He unwrapped another roll, and then held the broom
handle in place as he anchored it and covered it from calf to calf.

By this time, the fiberglass had set enough that Monique could no longer feel his hands as
he wrapped and smoothed. This was her least favorite thing about fiberglass for casts. She liked
the colors, and she liked being able to be active in a cast so quickly after application, but
the shortened time of feeling his hands creating the cast on her body was the major drawback to
it, for her.

Quinn folded over the stockinette and padding at her ribcage, and then began working on
trimming and folding around the opening between her legs. He then finished the cast in the
purple fiberglass. Quinn had beads of perspiration on his brow from the work and Monique was
hot, and flushed from the heat of the chemical reaction and from being quite aroused.
\end{thought}

While I waited for the cast to finish setting, I cleaned up the cast room, and dumped out
the pail of water. I then helped her into the tank top and underwear and thought out the best
way to get her from the table to the wheelchair.

I loosened the leg supports and swung them out of the way. I put my right arm under the
small of her back and lifted up, rocking her forward, where my left arm was ready to catch her
under the thighs. I then lifted her up and into the chair. I adjusted the backrest up to suit
the seated position of the new cast.

At the stairway, I realized that the way I'd carried her up and down the stairs in the
previous cast wouldn't work. With her body now bent nearly ninety degrees in the middle, I had
to carry her over my shoulder, with her legs in front of me, and then go upstairs sideways.
Luckily, despite the more awkward position, it was still easier, due to the fiberglass cast
being much lighter.

Once in the bedroom, we chatted a bit as we wound down for sleep. As we chatted, I drew a
sketch of her in the new cast.

\begin{thought}
The heat from the cast setting had passed, and Monique was comfortable in the new cast. The
chill she'd experienced with the plaster cast didn't happen with the fiberglass, and she was
thankful for that. She still preferred plaster, but fiberglass had its' advantages, and she was
enjoying them. As they chatted, they went over what she'd tell people when she got the questions
that would fly at her as her friends saw the new cast. They also discussed a possible issue they
might have to deal with- signatures. While she hadn't solicited them, a few people had asked to
sign her plaster cast, and she'd let them. This cast was going to be replaced next weekend, yet
they would be trying to pass the replacement off as the same cast. The dark color might
discourage people from asking to sign it, but if anyone did sign it, they'd have to duplicate
the graffiti on the replacement next Sunday.

As she watched Quinn work, the combination of the immobilization, and the sight of him
working was having the usual effect on Monique. The cast may have lost the heat from the
chemical reaction of setting, but she was feeling a new heat of a different sort. With her hips
bent to nearly 90 degrees in the new cast, she could think of a couple of ways that they could
make love while she was in the cast. When he finished, he joined her in the bed and she showed
him.
