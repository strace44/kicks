\chapter{}
Ah Mondays. Most people hate them, but I have come to love them. As the clock neared 9:00,
I was very eagerly awaiting Erin's arrival. It was cloudy outside, but it was going to be a
beautiful day inside.

When I heard the knock at the door, I knew the fun was about to begin. I opened the door,
and Erin looked great as usual. She didn't seem overdressed this time, yet was still dressed
very fashionably: She wore a black sleeveless jumpsuit. The zipper was unzipped far enough to
show a hint of cleavage, and the legs were short enough that it showed the top of the fantastic
pink long leg cast she had on her left leg. She had a Birkenstock on her right foot, and the bag
she carried was Gucci. She did like to do herself up.

I welcomed her inside, and we sat in the parlor and talked for a few minutes.

``I see you still have the long cast.''

``Yes,'' she said disgustedly. ``I go to the doctor on Friday. Hopefully I'll get a
shorter cast then.'' I thought to myself that I wouldn't be happy to see it go, though I DO want
her to heal.

``So, you're not scared off by today's plan?'' I asked.

``No. It's certainly going to be….. big.'' She said. ``But, then again, the money will be
really good, so I'm ready.''

Hmm- talking about the money. I think my internal alarm should have gone off, but all I
could think about was her situation: single, living alone, and unable to work. She was probably
just trying to keep the bills paid.

``Just remember that if this gets to be too much for you, just say the word, and we'll
stop and cut you out.'' I said. ``We should go ahead and get started- this will take some
time.''

She pulled herself up, and put her crutches under her arms. ``I'll be right there,'' she
said, heading for the bathroom.

I headed into the casting room, and started getting out the fiberglass rolls and padding.
I was going to need quite a bit today, and it was going to be great. I hoped it wouldn't be too
much for Erin. I reminded myself that it was she who had mentioned going to more and bigger
casts.

Erin crutched into the casting room, set her crutches against the wall, and hopped to the
table, where she turned and leaned back against the table, standing on her uncasted leg. She
unzipped the jumpsuit, pulled her arms out, and pulled it down. It was hard for me to not just
stop and watch her, but I had to remain professional. I did keep an eye on her out of the corner
of my eye. She hopped up on the table, and brought her right leg up and out of the suit. She
then stretched over to pull it off over the cast on her left leg. I wished I'd had a video of
this- a beautiful woman struggling with a cast to do an everyday activity. I couldn't help but
get a little heated up just watching it.

When she was done, she tossed the jumpsuit into the chair by the door, and sat up and
faced me. She looked great sitting there. She had a strapless bra and low cut underwear, just as
I had detailed to her on the phone.

``This bra is okay, isn't it?'' she asked.

``Yes, it's fine. We just needed for it to be strapless. Hang on, let me fill the bucket-
I'll be right back,'' I said.

I went through the usual routine of filling the bucket, and also retrieved the envelope
with the cash in it. My heart was racing at the thought of what was about to take place. I
calmed myself, and returned to the casting room. I handed her the envelope, and set the bucket
on the cart. She looked briefly in the envelope, and then lightly tossed it to the chair with
her clothes.

``Well, where do you want to start?' she asked.

``With the arm,'' I said.

She held out her left arm. I cut off a short length of one inch stockinette, and slit it
halfway up. I placed it over her thumb so that it extended past the end of her thumb, and the
flaps created by the slit lay on the front and back of her hand. Then, I took the three inch
stockinette, and cut off two and a half feet of it. I slid it over her arm to the elbow, and cut
a slit for her thumb to poke through. I took some two inch padding, and wrapped the thumb and
hand, making sure to use enough, but not too much of it. I wrapped the padding nearly to her
elbow, and ripped off the remainder of the roll.

After this was done, I looked up at Erin's face. She seemed to be watching what I was
doing, and lost in thought at the same time. I pulled on some gloves, and ripped open a roll of
two inch blue fiberglass, and dipped the roll until the bubbles stopped. I wrung it out, and
began wrapping her hand and thumb. I wrapped fairly quickly, but made sure to keep the
fiberglass smooth. I finished the roll by working it to past her wrist. I trimmed the length of
the stockinette and padding at the fingers and thumb, and folded it over. I then used another
roll of two inch fiber to anchor the ends down and give the cast the proper thickness.

After the second roll of two inch fiber ended at her wrist, I took a roll of three inch
fiberglass, and started wrapping it near her elbow. I worked down to the wrist and back. I had
enough thickness before the roll ran out. I held the roll in my left hand, and folded the
padding and stockinette over at the top of the cast, and then anchored it with the rest of the
roll. I did a little final smoothing of the cast, and then announced ``One down, one to go.''

She held up her casted left hand, looking at the cast curiously. ``This is a cast for a
broken thumb? She asked.

``Yes. That and certain types of wrist fractures.'' I said.

``It's getting warm.''

``Yes, it will be set soon. Keep your hand still for now, though. We probably should have
done that cast last, because we need to wait for it to set to do the other one.''

``Oops,'' she said.

``I need to get some things ready, so it will be okay,'' I answered.

I got the tall stool from the corner of the room and brought it to close to the table. I
then got my homemade leg stand, as well as two broom handles. I took Erin's left hand and
examined the cast. There were tiny droplets of water sweating out from the exothermic reaction
of the fiberglass drying. It still wasn't ready.

``Well, we still have a few minutes.'' I told her. ``Would you like something to drink
while we wait?''

``Sure, but not too much,'' she answered. ``I don't want to have to run to the bathroom in
the middle of this.''

I went to the kitchen and got sodas for us. As we sat and drank them, I tried to get her
to talk. I asked questions about her job, music, and what sort of activities she liked, but her
answers were fairly short and it seemed she wasn't too interested in talking about herself too
much. After we'd finished our drinks, the cast was dry enough to go on.

``I'll need you on the stool here for the next cast.'' I held out my hand, and she took it
with her right hand, and pulled herself up onto her right leg. She turned to line up with the
stool, and I held on as she lowered herself onto the stool. I picked up her casted left leg, and
slid the stand underneath it. Even though she was very distant, it was nice helping her move
into position.

I took the roll of twelve inch stockinette, and cut off a long length. I asked her to
raise her arms, and slid the soft material over her body after she'd done so. I smoothed it out,
making sure not to touch her in any way that might offend her. (I hoped) I pulled it down to
past her butt at the bottom, and left some of it bunched up at the top, which was in line with
her armpits. I wrapped six inch padding over the stockinette from the swell of her hips to her
armpits, and over her chest. I made sure to wrap the padding loose enough so as not to flatten
her breasts.

Before I opened the rolls of fiberglass, I warned her. ``As I make this cast, I'm going to
have to smooth it out, and that will include over your chest. I know we discussed this on the
phone, but you're sure you're okay with it?''

``Yes, it's okay.'' She said. ``I've been felt up before.''

``I'm not doing it to feel you up, Erin.'' I said. (Not entirely true) ``If you don't want
to, we can stop with what we've got.''

``No. Go ahead. I'm sorry if that sounded bitchy.'' She said.

``I just want to make sure you're okay with this.'' I replied.

``I'm fine. Go ahead.''

``Alright, ``I told her. ``I'm going to need for you to hold your arms up and out to your
sides. Hold on to these to keep them from getting tired.'' I handed her the broom handles, which
she took and positioned her arms.

I ripped open the first roll of five inch purple fiberglass, dipped it, and began wrapping
at her hips, working upwards. I deliberately started a bit low, but I would trim up this area
before the cast was finished. I worked my way upward, and I very much enjoyed the process. I
remained very professional, touching her only as much as was necessary to smooth the rolls as I
applied them. I continued wrapping her in the purple fiber until I had the cast nice and thick
from hips to armpits. I went ahead and pulled the padding and stockinette over at the top of the
cast, and anchored it. By the time I had finished this, the bottom of the cast was set enough to
trim. I took my cast saw, and cut the lower area of the cast back enough to allow her to move
her hips, but left it low in the back, and in the center of the front. I pulled the padding and
stockinette back, and anchored them with a final roll of fiberglass.

We waited a few minutes while this dried. Now, she was asking me questions. Mostly about
the cast fetish, and the man who was financing this. I answered her questions as best I could,
keeping up the facade of there actually being an external financier. She seemed to be very
interested in the type of person who would pay for what we were doing. I fended off most of the
questions with the ``I'm just doing my job'' dodge. I was starting to wonder if she might be
angling. I hoped I was wrong. I had been waiting for her to soften up a little bit. I was hoping
she'd get friendly enough for me to ask her out, but now I wondered if I wanted to. I reminded
myself that for the time being, I just need to enjoy the day.

After the body cast had dried, I helped her into the wheelchair, and pushed her into the
living room, where I took pictures of her in various poses: in the wheelchair, standing on
crutches, sitting and lying on the couch. I decided to take her to the breakfast nook, and we
took several more pictures in various poses. One pose, where she stood by the window, leaning
against the wall without the crutches, was the one that I sketched her in. Today had been a step
forward in that I was able to get her to smile more, but even the smiles seemed forced and
insincere. Still, she was beautiful, and she really filled out a cast nicely. I suppose I needed
to stop thinking of her in terms of a romantic possibility, and just as an employee.

After the sketch was done, I wheeled her back to the casting room, and cut her out of the
casts. Despite the body cast being big, it was fairly quick to get her out, as it only required
a straight cut up each side. I cut the stockinette and padding on only the left side, and freed
her from the cast. Five minutes after that, the thumb spica was off, also. I handed her a cloth
to wipe the dust off of herself.

After she'd done this, she grabbed her jumpsuit, and got herself dressed. We said our
goodbyes, and she crutched down the sidewalk. I wasn't sure what to think of her, now. I'd been
highly attracted to her, but now I wasn't sure. Maybe I'm wrong. Either way, I'll have to wait
until next Monday to find out any more.

After I had cleaned up from the casting session with Erin, I knew I had to get out of the
house for a while. The clouds of this morning had given way to a beautiful day, so I got out the
Harley and went for a ride.

I rode through the town, enjoying the feel of the afternoon sun and the wind in my face.
Before I knew it, I was out near the local mall. I had wanted to get a new CD from one of my
favorite artists, so I went to the Borders store located across the street from the mall.

I went straight to the music section, and found the disc I wanted. I was browsing some of
the other music when something caught my eye. Over in the section near the magazines and the
overpriced coffee counter, there was a woman sitting at a table reading. She was seated with her
back was to me, but she had very pretty long brown hair, and appeared to have a nice figure from
what I could see. What had caught my eye was the pair of aluminum crutches leaning against the
table.

Being a caster, I had to move in to get a closer look at this person. Not wanting to be
obvious, I went to the magazine section and picked up a copy of Hemmings Motor news. I went to
the coffee counter and ordered a double espresso. I turned from the counter and walked toward
the table next to the woman.

As I got closer to the table, I almost dropped my coffee. I noticed that she had her left
foot up on a chair. Her ankle was wrapped in an Ace bandage. She was wearing shorts and a
t-shirt, and she was indeed very beautiful. It was Monique!

I walked toward Monique, and as I neared, she looked up. When she saw me, her face turned
red.

``Hi, Quinn.''

``Hi, Monique, what happened?''

She paused for about a half a second, and said ``I tripped on the steps at my apartment.
Nothing serious, just sprained my ankle a little bit.''

``Ouch!'' I said. ``Did you see a doctor for it?''

``Yes. They even X-rayed it. I wondered for a while if I might get a cast for more than a
few hours. As it tuned out, it's just a mild sprain. They wrapped it, and gave me the crutches.
Told me to take ibuprofen and stay off of it for a few days.''

I smiled jokingly. ``If you want a cast for more than a few hours, there's a less painful
way to do it.''

She blushed a little again, and then said ``Where are my manners? Sit down.''

I took the chair opposite of her, and sat down. ``Do you need to skip this Friday?'' I
asked, sipping the strong coffee.

``No, no- I'll be there,'' she said. ``It's really not very bad. I can walk on it already,
but it hurts a lot if I walk too much on it. But it's not anything to keep me from working. Do
we have our…assignment yet?''

I had to think fast. ``Well,'' I started, ``he wanted to see you outdoors in a city
setting. I was thinking about Cincinnati. He said he liked you in leg casts, so he mentioned a
below the knee cast on one leg, and an above the knee cast on the other.''

``I can do that just fine.'' She said. ``I've been getting some practice with the
crutches, too.''

Despite the fact that I really felt some anonymity towards Monique, I didn't want to
aggravate her injury. ``We can bring along the wheelchair, just in case it gets to be too
much,'' I told her.

``That's fine, but I should be alright.''

I got up from the table. ``So, I'll see you Friday at 9:00?''

``I'll be there. She said.
I went to the cash register, paid for my disc and the unread Hemmings. Then I got on the bike
and headed back home, thinking about what I had just seen. It seemed somehow surreal.

\begin{thought}
After Quinn had gone, Monique could not concentrate on her magazine. ``Two leg casts, and
in public, too!'' She thought to herself. ``I can't wait! There will be a LOT of people around.
It's going to be a blast. She got up, dropped her empty cup into the trash, paid for her
magazine, and crutched out to her car. As she drove home, she replayed the meeting in the store
in her mind. It was very nice to see Quinn, and she'd enjoyed their chat, even if it was brief.
She wished she could've gotten him to stay and talk longer, and maybe about something besides
business, even if business to him was pleasure to her. She'd really been caught off guard,
though. The way she was feeling about Quinn played a part in her feeling off guard, but she was
also sure that he would see right through the huge lie she'd told him. She was afraid he would
know that she'd never hurt her ankle, but was faking it with a bandage and crutches she'd gotten
at the drugstore last Friday.
