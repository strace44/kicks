\begin{thought}
Monique was on fire. Not literally, but it felt like it. Beads of perspiration dotted her
brow and her chest. There were two reasons for this: the exothermic reaction of the plaster
setting was still giving off quite a bit of heat in her legs and feet. The reaction was
diminishing around her midriff and hips, but that's where the other reason came in- she was
immobilized in plaster from her ribs to her toes. She was in a very sensual position, and the
rigidness of the cast around her hips was driving her crazy with desire. Of course, the cast was
still too fragile to attempt to find a way to satisfy that desire, but that fact did nothing to
lessen the feelings she had.
\end{thought}

When I had finished my sketch, I set it and my pencil aside, and surveyed the casting room.

It was a mess. Plaster drips on the floor and the table, and though I'd brought a trash can
close, somewhere in the casting, I'd stopped using it. There were a good number of plaster
wrappers on the floor as well. I excused myself for a moment, and dumped the water in the bucket
and refilled it with clean water for the cleaning.

As I worked on the mess, Monique and I talked. About her semester of school that was
starting, her schedule, and when the first chance would come for us to break away for the hiking
trip I'd promised her. She was taking a full class load, and we wouldn't be able to get away
until late October. Though it was a couple of months away, she'd figured out where she wanted to
go, and told me we needed to reserve our cabin soon. When I'd finished with the cleanup, she
asked me to get her laptop.

\begin{thought}
Monique was a bit nervous as she powered up the laptop. While she knew that Quinn trusted
her, and had asked her to plan this trip out, it still made her uneasy, planning this trip with
his money. She remembered what he'd told her in Indianapolis, but she still had reservations.
Using the computer was a bit tricky, lying flat on her back, but with her head propped up, and
the laptop lying across the cast on her stomach, she was able to manage.
\end{thought}

``Alright,'' she started. ``Are you ready for the details of the trip?''

``Yes, very much. Where are we headed?''

``Well, considering we'll only have six days, I don't want to spend too much time on travel.
What do you think of the Smoky Mountains?''

``I've been there several times. It's very beautiful.'' I answered.

``Have you ever done any hiking there?'' she asked.

``No,'' I replied. ``In fact, I've never spent more than a couple of days there at a time. Is
the hiking there good?''

``It sure looks like it!'' And with that she started opening pages she'd bookmarked about the
park. The pages gave information about some of the trails, and it looked interesting. What
interested me more was the obvious enthusiasm that showed in Monique's eyes as she was telling
me about it. When she'd shown me all of the pages she wanted to about the park, She looked up at
me and asked ``What do you think?''

``Sounds awesome to me. What did you have in mind for accommodations? You said something
about a cabin.''

``Well,'' she started, ``There is no shortage of places in the area to stay. There are tons of
hotels, motels and chalets in nearby towns, but we can get a cabin out away from town, out in
the woods, where we can have some privacy. That would be nice for a lot of reasons,'' she said,
tapping the side of her cast.

I laughed. ``You're terrible- this plaster isn't even dry, and you're thinking about more
casts. But, you wanted this to be a hiking trip.''

``And it will be. But I want to take some supplies along, too. Just in case. Now, let's look
at some cabins.''

She started navigating through some websites showing cabins. They were available in all
ranges of size, with varying amenities and privacy. We finally decided on one that looked great:
It was decently sized, but not big. It had a hot tub and a fireplace, and the website described
it as â€˜very secluded.'' A quick check revealed that it was available the week we planned to be
there. I handed Monique the phone and went to retrieve a credit card for the reservation fee.

When I returned to Monique she was talking to the rental agency. I handed her the credit
card, and she took it uneasily. When she had given all of the information, she thanked the clerk
and hung up. She handed the card back to me.

``That wasn't so hard, was it?'' I asked.

``It didn't feel right. I just don't feel comfortable spending your money.''

``Why?! If I can't share it with you, what good is it?''

``I know you're right,'' she sighed. ``And I suppose it will get easier. Just try to
understand that I've always been in a situation where money has been scarce or non-existent. To
spend it on something frivolous like a trip is just unusual for me.''

``I think I can see where you're coming from, Monique. But I need for you to try to
understand where I am coming from: all my life, money has been plentiful. I've had a steady
stream of friends and girlfriends who only seemed to care about me because I had money. It's a
new and wonderful experience for me to be with someone who not only isn't greedy, but is
downright frugal.''

``Well, we'll just have to work on meeting in the middle,'' she said.

``Fair enough.'' Changing the subject, I asked ``How's things inside the cast?''

``Getting chilly. The heat is all past. Other than that, it feels wonderful!''

I excused myself for a moment to go to the other room to turn down the air conditioning.
When I returned, I continued checking her over to make sure everything was alright.

``Do you have any numbness or pressure anywhere?'' As I asked this, I moved to her feet and
checked capillary refill by pinching her toenails and making sure the color returned quickly
enough.

She giggled as I touched her toes. ``My butt is getting numb on this post, but nothing
inside the cast. How soon until I can move?''

``Not for a couple of hours, yet,'' I responded. ``The cast is still fragile. But if it's too
much, you know you only have to ask once and it will come off immediately.''

``Not a chance! I'm loving this! I know there will be times of discomfort. I knew that
before I asked for this cast. I'll be fine. But there is something I need from you now.''

``What's that?''

``I have to pee,'' she said.

Certainly the least pleasant aspect of having her in such a huge cast, we'd discussed how
we'd handle her elimination needs while she was immobilized, and had gotten a bedpan, as well as
a urinal designed for female use. I retrieved the urinal, and helped her take care of business.
When she was done, I dumped and rinsed it, and returned with a bottle of waterless hand
sanitizer, which we shared.

The moment was slightly uncomfortable for me. She must've sensed this, as she broke the
silence. ``That wasn't so bad, at least not for me. Are you okay?''

``It's kind of odd, but yes. I suppose if you were in a situation where you were in real
need, I wouldn't think twice about assisting you.''

``Oh, I'm definitely in a situation where the need is real. It's just not due to any medical
reason, it's because we have a naughty hobby,'' she said with a smile. ``Now, let's move on to
something else.''

``Okay. How about some lunch?'' I asked.

``Sounds good, but hold the soup,'' she said with a smile.

I made us some sandwiches, as they would not only be fast and easy to make, they would be
easy for her to eat lying flat on her back.

\begin{thought}
As she ate her sandwich, Monique noticed that the snugness of the cast around her stomach
was going to prevent her from eating much at a time. Before she'd finished the sandwich, she
could feel the cast getting more snug around her midsection. She handed Quinn the remainder of
the sandwich.
\end{thought}

``Is something wrong with it?'' I asked.

``No- I can just feel the cast getting tighter on my belly. I'm not going to be able to eat
as much at a time.''

Though it made perfect sense, I hadn't thought of this. She'd have to eat more often, since
she wasn't able to eat as much at a time.

``I'll cut us some fruit for a snack later on. Just let me know when you're hungry again.'' I
told her.

For the next few hours after lunch, we looked at different places to visit during our
upcoming trip: hikes that looked interesting, other places of interest in the immediate area,
and we even looked at several places within a day's drive of our cabin.

\begin{thought}
As they were looking through the different websites, Monique was getting colder. Even
though the air conditioning was off, and her still naked upper body was warm, inside the cast
she was cold and seemed to be getting colder. She thought of saying something, but decided to
try a bit longer to stick it out.
\end{thought}

As the afternoon sun started to shine through the West window, I decided it was time to
move her. I began by retrieving the reclining wheelchair, and setting it beside the table. I
reclined it to a position that looked to be about right. I could see that the armrests wouldn't
work with the way her legs were spread, so I removed them and set them aside. Then, I set about
moving her to the chair.

She was still supported under her shoulders, under her hips by the perineal post, and each
calf was resting in one of the tibial supports. I began by releasing the tibial supports and
placing them back on the equipment cart. I then placed one arm under her back, and the other
went under her thighs. The cast was damp, cold and smooth. She was quite heavy with the still
wet cast on, but I was able to get her to the chair without too much difficulty. I tried moving
the leg rests into position, but there was no good way to get them under her legs. I'd have to
find a way around that before we went out on Sunday.

As I began to wheel her to the makeshift hospital room, I wondered if her feet would clear
the door frame, and I quickly learned that they wouldn't quite make it. I raised her right side
up far enough so that she would clear, and laid her back down as soon as her feet were through
the door. I had to repeat the process to get her into the room with the hospital bed.

After I'd lifted her onto the hospital bed, I decided to turn her over. I raised her right
leg until her legs were perpendicular to the floor. I then scooted her to the near side of the
bed before letting her down slowly onto her stomach.

\begin{thought}
Moving in the double hip spica was interesting. Wait, there was almost no moving in the
cast. BEING moved in the cast was interesting. Everything below her ribs moved as one solid
unit. It was almost as if she were watching someone else being moved. She knew it was her body,
there were feelings coming from the area that wouldn't let her doubt that for a moment. But
having no input in the movement made it still feel slightly alien to her. She knew she would be
sleeping in this bed tonight, and Quinn would be there with her. But she realized that she
really wanted to spend tomorrow night in their bed. It wouldn't be easy, and it would be
difficult for Quinn, as their bed was upstairs. She decided to bring it up to him tomorrow, and
see if he felt it was a possibility.
\end{thought}

There was a television in the room, but it was at the opposite end. It was fine when the
``patient'' was lying on her back, but completely wrong now. I suggested to Monique that if we
turned her around, we could see if there was something decent on, or watch a movie. She was
gathering the pillows and putting them under her chest to prop herself up.

``Maybe later,'' she answered, adjusting a pillow. ``For now, let's play some chess and listen
to some music. I've got plenty of good music on my laptop, and I'll probably need it later
anyway. If you get it and the chess set, we'll be in good shape.''

I agreed, and went to retrieve the computer and chess set. I took them back to Monique, and
when I returned, I noticed that she was shivering. Her upper arms and shoulders were covered in
goosebumps.

What's wrong?'' I asked.

``The inside of this cast is v-v-very cold.'' She said.

I was dismayed. ``Do you need me to get you out?''

``No! I'll be okay. I just wish this thing would dry faster!''

``Let me get a blanket,'' I said as I turned to leave. I knew perfectly well that it wouldn't
help, at least not physically. What I needed was a huge blow dryer. Fans would help, but I
didn't have any. As I returned to Monique, I had an idea. I wasn't sure how much, but it would
speed up the drying process. I covered her with the blanket.

``Monique, I have an idea that should make the cast dry faster, but I'd have to leave to get
a few things.''

``Oh sure!'' she said with mock contempt. ``You're g-g-going to abandon me while I'm
helpless!''

I appreciated her humor at this time, but I was very focused on helping her. ``Seriously,
will you be alright for a half hour or so?''

``Yes, I'll be fine.''

I kissed her, and held her head in my hands for a moment. ``I love you Monique, I'll be back
as quick as I can.''

``I love you, too. Please be careful!''

I promised I would and I headed for the door. I was moving quickly, almost running as I
walked to the driveway. Her Expedition was between my truck and the road, so I got in and headed
for the home improvement store.

The store irritated me as they always do. It's always hard for me to find the tools or
building materials I need in them, as they have so many other types of things there. The fact
that I was already irritated by the fact that I'd missed something in my planning didn't help. I
found a couple of box fans, and headed for the lumber department, where I got a two by four. I
then headed for the tool department, where I picked up two halogen double work light fixtures
and a package of bungee cords. I then made a beeline for the checkout.

While I waited in line, I looked through the racks of useless crap by the checkout, and
something caught my eye- diaper wipes. I threw a couple boxes into the cart as the clerk was
ready for me.

While he was gone, Monique opened the music player and looked through the playlists. She
pulled up one labeled ``Rockabilly,'' and put it on shuffle. She wanted to bring up an idea to
Quinn and this music would set the tone for it. Besides, there was just some great music in
here, and she was in the mood for it.

\begin{thought}
She didn't know what he was planning to do, but she hoped it worked. She hated being cold,
and it didn't seem like the cast was warming up at all. She knew that it would, and she'd stick
it out as long as she had to, but she was a bit miserable with the chill.
\end{thought}

When I returned home, I went first to check on Monique. She was fine, but said that she was
freezing cold. I went back out and retrieved my purchases.

I quickly set up the light fixtures. I plugged them in and turned them on. I've used these
lights in the past, and they give out a tremendous amount of heat. I positioned them so that one
set shone on her midsection, and the other shone on her knees. The fans were next. I plugged
them into the outlets on the sides of the work lights, and moved them to the other side of her.
I turned them on low speed, and faced them away from her so they would draw the hot air across
the cast.

As I was setting up the drying apparatus, I noticed the unmistakable sound of Duane Eddy's
guitar twanging away at ``Rebel Rouser.'' Monique was setting the pieces on the chessboard in
front of her.

``Nice choice of tunes,'' I said, pulling up a chair and sitting down.

We spent the next few hours playing chess and listening to music. Some of it was old, some
new, but it all had that great 50's sound: standup basses being slapped, and sliding chords on
Gretsch guitars. The lamps and fans were doing the job. Monique said it was slowly warming up
inside the cast. When we bothered to check the time, it was nearly nine o' clock, and we were
hungry again. I didn't feel like cooking, and Monique said with a smile that she was in no
position to cook, so I called out for a pizza.

While we waited for it to arrive, I got my pad and pencil, and made a sketch of her lying
on the bed on her stomach. She tossed the pillows aside, and held her head up with her left
hand. She crossed her right arm in front of her, covering her still naked breasts.

While Quinn worked, Monique brought up her idea.

``Quinn, in September, there is a huge car show in Illinois. It's a total old school event-
customs and hot rods, nothing newer than the mid 1960's. There will be a lot of live bands
playing this kind of music, and they even have a contest for pinup girls.''

She had my interest. When I'd finished the drawing, she brought up a website about the
show. It looked like a lot of fun, and we decided to try and go.

Monique had been on her stomach for a while, and since we'd soon be asleep for the night, I
turned her to lie on her back once again. I covered her with a blanket, and nestled in beside
her. There wasn't a lot of room to spare, but I managed to find enough to get comfortable. We
talked for a while, and soon the day caught up with me and I drifted off to sleep.

\begin{thought}
Monique lay awake a while longer. She was having trouble getting comfortable. While the cast
was perfectly made, the immobility was bothering her slightly. Normally, at this time, she'd
move a bit, snuggle up to Quinn, and be asleep within minutes. Tonight, her hips and knees
begged to move just a little bit. Still, this discomfort only served to clarify the experience,
making it more real. The intense arousal she'd felt earlier had faded, but not completely. If
Quinn woke up and wanted to try something, she'd be wound up within a few minutes, whether the
cast was fully dry or not. She knew she'd soon get the chance to. This weekend was going to pass
too quickly. So far, this was proving to be as great as she expected, and it was only going to
get better. That was the last thought that went through her mind before she drifted off to sleep
and dreams like none she'd ever dreamt before.
