``Excuse me…'' I hadn't noticed the middle aged couple walking our way. Now, they were at our
table, and the man was addressing us.

``I'm sorry to interrupt your lunch, but I couldn't help but notice your casts,'' he said to
Monique. He seemed slightly nervous as he asked, or maybe that was my imagination.

``I can't help but notice, either.'' Monique said with a smile. ``Hi, I'm Monique, and this is
Quinn,'' she added as she nodded my direction.

``I'm Dave,'' the man answered, smiling at Monique's remark. ``And this is my wife Molly.'' He
turned back to Monique. ``I didn't mean to stare, and I am very sorry if we bothered you. I used
to be an orthopedic technician, and leg casts attached with a spreader bar are extremely rare.
In fact, I've never seen them on an adult, except in books on the history of orthopedics.''

``This could be tricky'', I thought to myself. This guy isn't going to buy just any story.
Perhaps we should just come clean and hope they just go away shaking their heads.

\begin{thought}
``This should be fun,'' Monique thought to herself. ``Let's see if I can fool a professional.''
\end{thought}

``Actually,'' I started $\ldots$ But Monique cut me off.

``Well,'' she said. ``After the accident, they wanted to do surgery to repair the breaks, but
I begged them not to. I had a friend who slipped on ice and broke her leg. They did surgery on
her leg, and she ended up getting an infection. She spent a month in the hospital, and in the
end, she lost her leg just below the knee. I had to argue with the doctors for a day and a half
before they agreed to put me in this cast.''

``Wow!'' Dave said. ``Most doctors don't like to be second guessed. I'm surprised that he
agreed to do it. If you don't mind my curiosity, what happened to you?''

\begin{thought}
Dave seemed rather surprised at her story, but if he wasn't believing it, she couldn't
tell. Then again, she didn't know him, so she might not be able to tell.
\end{thought}

``A tornado hit my apartment building, and a wall fell on me.''

``Ouch! That's terrible! What bones did you break?''

I just sat there, watching the exchange between Dave and Monique. Molly watched, too. She
seemed a bit shy, as though she were slightly uncomfortable by the way Dave was asking questions
of a total stranger.

\begin{thought}
``Be careful, here.'' Monique thought to herself. ``At the salon, you rattled off a ridiculous
list of broken bones, and the girl ate it up. This guy won't believe just anything. Simpler is
better, here.''
\end{thought}

``I broke both of the lower leg bones on this side,'' she said, bending forward as much as
possible and pointing to her left leg. ``I broke the big bone in my lower leg on this side,''
She
said, pointing to the right. ``But the really bad part was that I broke the upper leg bone at
the
hip on this side,'' as she touched her left hip, ``and I also had a break in my pelvis, but they
said the bones hadn't moved out of place.''

``Non displaced pelvic fracture,'' Dave said.

``Yes!'' Monique said. ''That's what they called it.''

``So, you're actually in a double hip spica cast, then?''

``Yes, I knew they had a special name for it, but I'd forgotten what it was until you just
said it,'' she said.

``That's a cast that they never use on adults anymore,'' Dave said. I'm surprised that they
did it.

Monique was weaving a nice little story, and actually appeared to be deceiving a
professional. I had to chime in.

``She can be VERY enthusiastic about getting her way at times,'' I said.

``Well,'' Dave said. ``We've intruded on your time long enough. Again, I apologize for being
nosy. It's just something that I've never seen before, and my professional curiosity got the
best of me.''

``That's OK.'' Monique said. ``I get a lot of questions whenever I'm out.''

``I'll bet you do!'' He replied. ``It was nice to meet you both. You two have a great day, and
get well soon, Monique.''

``You two have a great day, too.'' I said.

As Dave and Molly walked away, they talked between themselves once they were out of
earshot. I could see them, but Monique was facing away from them.

``Do you think he believed me?'' She asked.

``I don't know, but they're talking,'' I told her. ``Either he's explaining how unlikely your
cast is, he's telling her that he thinks your story was bullshit, or he's trying to explain away
why he was talking to such a pretty gal right in front of her.''

``Honestly, from the way he looked at me, I don't think he was checking me out, just the
cast.'' She said.

``I'd like to be a fly on the wall and hear what they're saying.'' I told her. ``Medically,
your story was a stretch, but you played it well. You came off not sounding like someone knowing
a lot about orthopedics.''

We never knew it, but if we HAD heard the conversation, we'd have made a couple of new
friends that day. As they walked away, Dave said to Molly:

``I can't believe we just saw a medical DHS in public!''

``Do you think they might be casters?'' she asked.

``The cast is totally unbelievable, but she didn't sound like a caster when she talked.''

``Are we going to head back to the hotel, now? I'd like to get a nice hot soak before we get
started.''

``If you're ready to be immobilized, I'm ready to take care of you,'' he said with a smile.

``I am,'' she said with a small smile. ``But don't get any crazy ideas- I don't want another
hip spica. Not this time.''

After we finished our lunch, I paid and tipped the waitress, and I wheeled her back toward
the truck. As we walked along the sidewalk, inspiration hit me again, and I decided to do
another sketch of her. I found a spot that looked somewhat interesting that had a bench nearby.
As I sat and sketched her, Monique got more than the usual double takes and outright stares.

When I'd finished, we headed back to the truck, and along the way, we chatted about the day
so far, and what we would do next. Monique suggested that if I didn't mind an extra time
unloading and loading her, she'd like to go to a mall.

``Oh, looking for some new shoes, or a pair of jeans?'' I asked.

``Actually, I'm just looking forward to watching people react to me. We just fooled a former
orthotech. I'm feeling kind of bulletproof right now. But only if you don't mind''

``Being seen out in public with a beautiful woman in a huge cast? Uh, no- I don't mind it a
bit.'' I said, and stopped long enough to kiss her.

Going through the loading process, and then unloading once we'd found a mall that looked
big and busy was a pain. My idea for a hoist to assist in this was coming together, and I really
thought it would work. I decided that before we did another public adventure in a big cast, I'd
probably go ahead and have it built.

\begin{thought}
As they entered the mall, Monique enjoyed watching the way people reacted to her. One cast
always attracted attention, but both legs in casts, got even more. People looked a little
longer, or took an extra look over their shoulder as they walked away. Of course, they didn't
know how big the cast really was. But she did! She'd had a cramp or two in her hips, but nothing
serious. All in all, she loved the comfort and restriction of the cast. She couldn't deny that
she wasn't looking forward to getting it cut off later, but she knew that it had to end. For
now, she was just enjoying being with a great guy, and in a great cast. Then something caught
her eye.
\end{thought}

``Hey- let's stop there.'' She said, pointing to a kiosk in the middle of the walkway.

I saw the one she meant. The teenage girl working it was dressed like a flower child, and
the kiosk looked to have tie-dyed shirts, sandals, hemp jewelry and other fashion accessories
for people wanting the ``hippie'' look. As we looked, I wondered what Monique was interested in.
She'd never given me any indication that this style was anything she was interested in.

``Wanting some new sandals?'' I asked jokingly.

She played it up. ``Oh sure- now that I can't run away, you make me the butt of your jokes!''

By this time, we had the attention of the kiosk clerk.

``I'm sorry.'' I answered. ``I'm just trying to make the best of the situation.''

``Ok, I'll forgive you; on one condition,'' she said with a smile, then pointed to a small
display of sterling silver jewelry and asked the girl ``Can I see one of those toe rings?''

The girl smiled, said ``Sure!'' She took one of the rings out and said ``We have several
different styles. Let's see how this one looks. Is it OK if I put this on you?''

``Yes, please do!''

The girl was overly slow and gentle as she slipped the ring on Monique's toe. ``Is that OK?
I'm not hurting you, am I?'' she asked.

``No, no- not at all,'' Monique said, looking at her foot. ``What other styles do you have?''

I watched as she tried each one of the rings on Monique's toes. They tried several
different rings, and I have to admit, I was enjoying watching the whole thing. After the third
one, the girl asked the question. ``Sorry to be nosy, but what happened to you?''

Monique gave her the same story she'd used all day. ``I was in a tornado, and a wall fell on
me.''

``That sucks.'' The girl said, slipping on another style of toe ring. Finally, Monique
settled on a style she liked, and we got her one for each foot. I rolled her away with her new
foot jewelry in plain view.

We spent the next hour or so just walking through the mall. We didn't go into too many
shops, due to a lot of them having aisles too small. Eventually, we made our way to the food
court, and stopped to have a cup of coffee.

As we sat, we sipped coffee and chatted.

``Quinn,'' she started, ``this weekend has been a lot of fun. Everything about it has been
everything I imagined it would be.''

``Everything?'' I asked. When you were lying there shivering to death was a lot of fun?''

``Okay, that was a bit uncomfortable, but it was the only thing that was. I was totally
relaxed when you put the cast on me. Okay, I was totally relaxed physically,'' she added with a
smile. ``There were certain parts of me that were quite excited during the casting.'' I smiled
at
that.

``I don't think you know how much I've enjoyed the weekend, too.'' I told her. ``I love
putting casts on you, I love taking care of you while you're in them, I love taking you out and
showing you off in them, and then there are the other activities, too,'' I added with a raise of
my eyebrows. ``You're like no other woman I've ever known. Making love with you is always
wonderful, but when we have to find ways to work around casts, it adds an extra bit of fun.''

She went on. ``When you took me upstairs, that was amazing. I thought I was going to go
insane before you stopped. And then, I didn't think you were going to let me take care of you.''

``I was perfectly content for you not to. You can't imagine how much I enjoyed just making
you go crazy.''

Again, the smile appeared. ``And today has been a great day. I got pampered, I was the
center of attention and sympathy pretty much everywhere we went, I fooled several people,
including a cast technician that I'm actually badly hurt.''

``We THINK you fooled him. We don't know for sure,'' I corrected.

``Okay, we don't know for sure, but I bet we did. It's just been a gr…''

``Monique?'' asked a female voice from my left. We turned to see two young women in their
early twenties with shopping bags in their arms.

\begin{thought}
Monique recognized the two girls. One of them was named Angela- they'd had a few classes
together at school. The other one she knew she'd had a class with a couple of semesters ago.
They hadn't ever really talked, but she was pretty sure her name was Kaye.
\end{thought}

``Oh, Hi!'' Monique said. ``How have you guys been?''

``It looks like we've been a lot better than you!'' Angela said. ``What the hell happened to
you?''

I was stunned. I didn't know what Monique was going to say, but this was definitely a
caster's worst nightmare- being caught out in public in a cast.

\begin{thought}
From the moment she'd seen them, Monique was quickly trying to think what she was going to
say when they asked the obvious question. But, when they asked it, none of those things were
what came out. An idea flashed into her mind, and she let it out.
\end{thought}

``Did you hear about the tornado that went through right after last semester?'' Monique
asked.

``Oh no! Please don't be doing what I think you're doing.'' I thought to myself.

They both nodded. Kaye(?) said ``We all heard about that. The news said it was one of the
worst ones ever.''

The ramifications of what I already knew Monique was about to say played through my mind,
and I felt a slight twinge of panic.

Monique told her story. ``My apartment building got hit pretty hard. A wall fell on me.''

``Oh my God!'' Angie exclaimed. ``I saw that your building got hit. I was hoping you were OK.
Everyone I asked said they hadn't seen you since then. I guess I know why, now.''

``I've haven't been out too much, obviously''

``It's pretty amazing that you're out at all. My God- those casts go past your knees, and
that bar between them has to be awful!'' said Kaye(?)

``Actually,'' Monique said, reaching for the bottom of her top, ``It's all one big cast.'' She
pulled back her top just enough so that the girls could see a bit of her casted midriff. Their
jaws both fell open.

``Oh fuck! A body cast!'' Angie said. ``A body cast for summer vacation. I think I'd go
crazy!''

``Well, after lying in a hospital in traction for two weeks, I was glad to get out, even if
was with these concrete long johns. It hasn't been much fun, but I try to remind myself that
it's only temporary. As bad as it is, I remind myself that I could have been killed, or been
permanently handicapped. Not everyone was this lucky.'' (``I'm such a liar,'' she thought.
``It's
been awesome, and now it gets to be awesome for a while longer!'')

``How much longer do you have to wear it? Oh my god- classes start this week! Are you going
to have to go to class in it?'' asked Kaye(?)

``I'm going to try,'' she said. ``I'm hoping that I won't have to wear it too much longer. The
doctor has said as soon as my hip and pelvis heal, he's going to let me just have a cast on each
leg.'' Monique said. ``Hey- you two haven't met Quinn,'' she said, motioning toward me. ``He's
been
so awesome to me through all of this.''
