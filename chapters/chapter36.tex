I wasn't sure where she was headed with her conversation, but she clued me in.

``What if our casting adventures were decided at random? Have you ever read ``The Bet?'' She
asked.

``You mean the casting story online?''

``Yes,'' she answered. ``Do you remember where they decided the wife's casts by drawing slips
of paper out of a hat?''

``Yes.'' I remembered the story well. I had always enjoyed that one quite a bit. I even drew
an illustration for the author based on his description of the casted heroine.

``What if we did something similar to that sometimes?''

``I'm listening.'' Actually, I was getting excited about where this was going. ``How do you
want to make it work?''

We spent the rest of the trip home discussing her idea, and fine tuning it. When we got
home, I carried her up the stairs to the back door, as we'd planned. Once inside, I got a pencil
and paper, and handed it to her, and she began writing quickly. When she was done, she showed me
what she'd come up with, and asked what I thought of it. I read it over carefully. I liked what
I saw. I was glad we wouldn't use it every time, but from time to time, this could be a lot of
fun.

``So, when do we try it out?'' I asked.

``I have to work the next two days.'' She said. ``Let's try it out Saturday.''

``Sounds good to me.'' I said, and then added ``Are you ready to have your legs back? It's
getting late.''

She got her self up out of the chair and leaned toward me. I moved forward to hold her up,
and she put her arms around me. She stroked the side of my face and said ``How about we take
them
off tomorrow morning?'' I slid my arm around her waist, feeling the smooth warm skin just above
the waist of her shorts.

``That sounds like a great idea.'' I said, as we melted into a long passionate kiss.

Saturday morning, we prepared for our unknown casting adventure. We didn't know what we'd
be doing, but here was the plan. First, she was going to determine the number of ``injuries''
she
had. She was going to use a random number generator on the computer

We had talked at length about how high the number of injuries could go. I wanted a lower
number, but she wanted it to be possible for her to end up in a full body cast. She'd
established a list of 40 castable injuries, from something as minor as a broken hand, all the
way up to differing types of spinal vertebrae. She had assigned numbers to each injury. The
injuries that would cause the more enjoyable casts, such as long arm and long leg casts, had
more numbers correlating to them, so that they would be more likely to occur than some of the
more obscure things. Our plan was that once the number and types of ``injuries'' had been
established, I would be the doctor, and type and material for immobilization would be at my
discretion.

``Let's get started,'' she said. ``I'll go make the list and surprise you with it. I'll be
right back.''

Five minutes later, she returned to the casting room and lay down on the table.

``Doctor, your patient was in an accident,'' she said. ``Here are the results of the X-rays
that you ordered.'' She handed me a folded slip of paper. I opened the paper to find the
following:

\begin{verbatim}
Patient: Sarazin, M- MVA:
Right Radius
Right Tib/Fib
Right Patella
Left Wrist
Left Elbow
Left Ankle
T10 Vertebra
L2 Vertebra
\end{verbatim}

Interesting. I went through each injury in my mind, and quickly came up with my prescribed
method of ``treatment.'' Playing up the whole scenario a bit, I announced to my ``patient:''

``Monique, as we suspected, you have several fractures to all of your extremities, and two
fractured vertebra. For any of these injuries by themselves, I would suggest surgical fixation.
However given the number of fractures, and the trauma you've already been through, I am going to
reduce the breaks and treat you with plaster casts.''

Monique giggled a bit, and then played along herself. ``Oh, no!'' she said with feigned
horror. ``How long will I have to wear the casts?''

``Oh, I think you'll be all healed by tomorrow night,'' I said, cracking a smile. ``That's if
we get them on you quickly. Let's get started.''

``Doctor, am I going to have a body cast?'' she asked, with a fake look of concern on her
face. She was trying to keep from smiling.

``Yes, I'm afraid that we'll have to put you in a body cast to keep your back stable while
it heals. In fact, we'll do that first. I'll need you to stand up.''

``On two broken legs?!'' she said with a smile as she stood up.

I unbuttoned her shorts and le them fall to the floor. She stepped out of them, and kicked
them to the corner. I them took her top off, followed by her bra. She stood there, naked except
for her panties, waiting for her casts. I couldn't help thinking about how lucky of a guy I was.

``My legs and arms are not hurting a bit,'' she said as she stood there.

``You know, there's nothing keeping us from getting a proper casting table- one where we
could put on a body cast with you lying down'' I told her.

Her eyes lit up. ``Maybe if I'm really good, Santa will put one in my stocking?''

``Maybe,'' I said, taking the piece of 12 inch stockinette I had just cut, and sliding it
down over her head onto her beautifully curved body. I bunched it slightly at her armpits, and
pulled the lower part down past her buttocks. I got the two broom handles from the corner, and
handed them to her to steady her arms out to the side, out of the way.

I took a roll of 6 inch padding, and cut two 24 inch pieces, folded them into thirds, and
placed them over her hip bones on each side. I then took the rest of the roll and began wrapping
at her thighs, anchoring the two extra pieces I'd just made. I used two more rolls of 6 inch
padding wrapping her from thighs to armpits, making sure not to smash her breasts too much. She
looked beautiful, wrapped in snowy white padding. I gave her a quick kiss, and excused myself to
get a bucket of water.

\begin{thought}
``This is turning out to be even more fun than I expected,'' Monique thought to herself as
she stood still, feeling the slight constriction and warmth of the stockinette and padding
encircling her body. She'd secretly been hoping for a double hip spica, but the numbers hadn't
indicated the bones that would call for such a cast. She could have just written what she
wanted, but she wasn't going to be dishonest, not even that much. She'd rather just ask for one.
Maybe she'd do that soon.
\end{thought}

I set the bucket of water on the cart, and got several boxes of plaster bandages in various
widths. I opened a box of 6 inch plaster, and began removing the wrappers from the rolls. I
pulled on a pair of gloves, and asked Monique if she was ready.

``Yes, Doctor. The sooner we finish, the sooner I can begin my convalescence.''

I dipped a roll of the plaster and began wrapping it at her hips. I was starting low: a
good bit of the lower part would be trimmed away, but I wanted the cast to come low at the rear
and front. I worked my way up her body, molding the plaster to her hips and waist. Despite the
fact that the cast was getting thick, her feminine shape was still obvious. I wrapped layer
after layer until I had worked all the way to her armpits. I rolled the padding and stockinette
down over the top of the cast, and anchored it with another roll of plaster. I then smoothed the
plaster out over the entire surface of the cast.

``How does that feel?'' I asked.

``It feels fine, doctor.''

\begin{thought}
Actually, it felt wonderful. The plaster was getting hot as it set. It was almost
uncomfortable, but not quite. She could feel the heavy cast pulling her down, and her body
sweating slightly beneath it.
\end{thought}

``I'll trim it up a bit to allow you to move your legs, but I'd rather wait until it sets a
bit more,'' I told her.``In the meantime, I'll take care of your arms.''

One at a time, I casted her arms in long arm casts: Three inch stockinette up to the
armpit, followed by padding and more plaster. It took about 45 minutes to encase both arms in
smooth hard plaster from the fingers to nearly the armpits. I suspected that she had to be
getting a bit uncomfortable, standing perfectly straight, with each arm hanging down under the
weight of the setting plaster. She was being great, holding each arm slightly away from the body
cast so as not to dent any of the casts.

``Monique, you've got to be getting uncomfortable.''

\begin{thought}
``Yes, a little,'' she replied. She was more than just a little bit uncomfortable; her
shoulders were burning from holding the heavy arm casts away from the body cast, and her legs
were starting to go to sleep from standing still for almost two hours. Even with the discomfort,
she loved every minute of this adventure, which was only beginning.
\end{thought}

``Hang on; the doctor knows what you need.'' I went to the ``hospital room'' and got all of the
pillows. I returned to the casting room, and laid them out on the table. The body cast was
pretty well set at this point, and it shouldn't dent if I laid her down, provided she was well
padded.

I stood behind Monique, knees slightly bent. I put one arm around her back, slightly above
her waist, and the other behind her thighs. ``Ok,'' I said. Just lean back into my arms, and
I'll
pick you up and put you on the table.

``Whatever you say, Doctor,'' she giggled. ``Just don't drop me!'' She leaned back, and I caught
and lifted her. I had to put her on the table quickly, as the plaster made her very heavy, and I
couldn't hold her up for long.

``Ah, that feels a lot better,'' Monique sighed. ``My arms were really starting to hurt.''

``How does the cast feel to lie down in?''

``It feels great. It's nice and snug, I'm not sinking in it at all. You've done very nice
work, doctor!''

``Thank you. I want it to be comfortable. Let's go ahead and finish it.'' I moved the cart to
the end of the table. ``I'm going to slide you down so that your butt is off of the table, and
your legs will be resting on the cart.''

``Ok. I'm ready whenever you are.''

I picked her up and moved her down so that I could access the lower part of her body cast.
I got a couple of pillows and placed them under her calves where they rested on the cart.

``Still comfortable?''

``Yes.''

``Alright, let's finish your treatment.''

I got out the cast saw and trimmed the plaster at the bottom of her body cast. The plaster
was mostly set, but not dry. I trimmed it back high at the sides of her hips, and at the front
of her thighs. This way she would be able to bend her hips. I left it low at the back and in the
middle of the front so that her back would remain immobile. I folded up the padding and
stockinette, pulled on a pair of gloves, and dipped a roll of 6'' plaster and began wrapping the
lower part of the body cast to anchor the padding and stockinette. As I was working, Monique
began talking.

``A proper casting table would have made this a lot easier, wouldn't it?''

``Yes, it would have been a lot easier.''

``How exactly does one work?''

``It's actually more of a frame than a table. You can attach straps to support the patient
in various areas, and then you can access the patient from all sides.''

``That not only sounds easier, it sounds like more fun,'' she said.''

``Yes, I think we should have one,'' I said, smoothing out the last roll of plaster. ``There,
that is done- now we can do your legs.''

``Can we take a bit of a break- I'm kind of thirsty.'' She asked.

``Sure. I could go for a smoke, myself.''

``Well,'' she started, ``I could too, but I'll need some help.''

``Dear, you're going to need a lot of help this weekend. I'll be back.''

\begin{thought}
This weekend. She liked the sound of that. She liked it a LOT. She was going to be pretty
helpless, and totally dependent on Quinn for everything. Two short months ago, she would have
hated to rely on another person for anything. Now, she was looking forward to a weekend of being
totally helpless. Had she changed that much? She didn't think she'd changed a bit, she'd just
met someone who didn't have to play by the same rules the rest of the world did. At any rate,
she didn't need to analyze it too much, she needed only to enjoy it, and she was certainly
enjoying it!
\end{thought}

I returned with two Diet Cokes, cigarettes and a lighter. I grabbed an ashtray, and placed
it on the table close to her head. I lit two cigarettes, and placed one in her mouth. I propped
her head up on a pillow, and took one of the diet cokes, and put a straw in it. I held the straw
close enough for her to take a drink, and took the cigarette so she could.

``Ah, that's much better,'' she said.

In between helping her with her soda and smoke, and enjoying my own, I took a damp rag, and
began cleaning the plaster from her upper chest, thighs, and upper arms. When she was all clean,
and we were finished with our smokes, I started on her legs.

I slid 4 inch stockinette up her right leg all the way to the top of her thigh, and on her
left leg to the knee. I wrapped 4 inch padding on each leg from the top down, to avoid bunching
the padding. I put on my gloves, and applied the plaster to her left leg. After anchoring the
ends, I smoothed it out, and set it on the pillow to dry. I then repeated the process for her
right leg, taking the plaster high up on her thigh on this side. I held the long leg cast for a
while, to give it a chance to set up before I moved her back onto the table to finish drying.

I excused myself and made us a quick lunch after I'd moved her back and finished cleaning
the plaster dribbles from her tanned skin. Of course, I had to feed her, which neither of us
seemed to mind much.

We sat and talked for a while as she dried. We never had trouble finding things to talk
about, and we never really needed to talk. We could enjoy being with each other in complete
silence, too. Around mid-afternoon, I decided to move her to the hospital bed to finish drying.
I didn’t want to move her around too much, as the casts wouldn't be completely dry for a while,
but I wanted to get her more comfortable than lying on the table.

``I think it's time to move the patient to her room.'' She nodded in agreement.

I went and got the wheelchair, and set the brake. I picked her up gently, and set her into
the chair. She was even heavier than before, with the leg casts, but I managed. I set the leg
rests to support her leg casts, and rolled her into the hospital room. It would have been easier
if she could have put weight on either leg, but I had to do all of the lifting without any help
from her. When I had her on the bed, I went and got my paper and pencil. She looked so helpless
and stunning, lying there with more of her gorgeous body in plaster than not.

\begin{thought}
Monique was in heaven. She lied in the bed, flat on her back, watching Quinn do the sketch
of her. This was already a great weekend, even if she got out of her casts right now and went to
work. She remembered the feel of Quinn's hands making the casts on her body. She was enjoying
the restriction she now felt as a result of being so heavily immobilized. She felt snug and
secure. She felt helpless, but not an unpleasant sort of helpless. This was a bit like a roller
coaster, where you're strapped in, and have no control over your situation. Yet, the ride is a
thrill, and this certainly was, too. All weekend, she had Quinn's undivided attention, and she
planned to enjoy every minute of it!
