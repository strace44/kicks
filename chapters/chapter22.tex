\chapter{}
Cassidy was nervous. Not in a way that hindered her ability to function, or even function
well. She was always nervous when working undercover. Setting a trap with herself as bait always
required making herself more vulnerable than any cop ever likes to be. Also, the very nature of
this work was bizarre, to say the least. She supposed that the nerves were probably a good
thing. If she got too comfortable working undercover, she might make a mistake, maybe a fatal
one.

She had a half hour before her meeting, and she and Johnson went over the plan one last
time. The technical officer had fitted her with a tiny microphone and receiver. It was so small;
it actually was hidden inside a fake hearing aid. Her hair covered her hears, but even if it was
seen, she had a story ready about being born with some hearing loss. The added benefit of this
type of setup is that it allowed the guys monitoring the conversation to talk to her, as well.
She also had a more sensitive microphone and transmitter hidden in her purse. This one would
pick up sounds within a 15 foot radius. The microphones were being monitored by separate
officers in a van parked half a block away from the suspect's house. The van had engineering
company markings, and there were even two additional officers outside the van who appeared to be
doing survey work. The van was already in place. Johnson would be in his car, a block away and
out of sight, but in constant radio communication with the officers in the van. Finally, there
were three additional officers in marked cars patrolling the area, able to assist within a
couple of minutes notice.

In the parking lot, Cassidy asked Johnson one last time: ``Why all of the undercover work
and expense? Tell me again why we didn't just go over and question this guy?''

Johnson sighed and smiled. ``Relax, Cass. We don't have any evidence that this guy is the
perp we're looking for. If we went in asking questions, we'd be treading a fine line with
harassment. If he IS our guy, with no evidence, we'd be likely to scare him off. Most likely,
he'd hurt some other woman before anyone picked up his trail again.''

``I know, I know. I just wanted to hear it again,'' Cassidy answered. ``This is just so
weird- posing for pictures in my underwear and a cast.''

``Highly weird.'' Johnson said. ``I know the cast worries you a bit, since it means you
won't be able to move as well in an emergency. That's why we have the extra patrols. Everyone
knows the situation, here. You say the panic word, and we come down on him like a ton of
bricks.''

``I trust all of you guys totally. Wish me luck.'' She said, getting into the department's
seven year old Toyota.

``Good luck, Cass. Just relax, and let's see if this is our scumbag. We're right
outside.'' Johnson said, shutting her door, and turning to his cruiser.

At 10:00am, a red Toyota pulled up and parked along the street in front of the house.
Samantha got out, looking as good as she had when I had met with her over the weekend to discuss
the modeling. Samantha was tall, probably about 5'10'', and very athletic. She was wearing a red
tank top, tight blue jeans and white tennis shoes. She opened the back door of the car, and got
a small duffel bag out of the back. When she bent to pick it up, a guy in a survey crew down the
road whistled at her. She scowled and jabbed her middle finger at him, and turned to the walk.

I let her inside, and we sat for a few minutes and talked before starting.

``So, you've never had a cast before, Samantha?''

``No, I've had several sprains, but I've never actually broken anything. And please, call
me Sam.''

Calling a beautiful woman 'Sam' seemed wrong to me. Sam was the butcher from ``The Brady
Bunch.'' But, if that was what she wanted, I guess I would.

``As I told you the other night, we'll be doing a small cast today. It's not really
indicative of what we'll be doing in the future, but it's a good place to start, especially
since you've never had a cast before. If you continue after today, we'll slowly progress to more
and bigger casts. Before we start, do you have any questions?''

``Just one: How do you take the cast off of me?'' Cass knew full well how a doctor removes
a cast. Despite the cover story, she had actually worn casts a few times. She had broken her arm
in a childhood fall, she'd broken an ankle while in high school, and had had her wrist broken
during an arrest a little over a year ago. She was asking mostly out of concern for her safety-
she didn't want this guy coming at her with a knife, or worse.

``I remove the cast the same way a doctor does,'' I told her. ``It's totally safe. Come on
into the casting room, and I'll show you.''

I led her into the casting room, and retrieved the cast saw from the cabinet. ``I know it
looks scary, but it cannot cut you.'' I plugged the saw in, turned it on, and held the blade
against my own hand. ``The action of the blade is back and forth. It will cut hard things like
casts, but not soft things, like skin.''

``Thanks, I feel better. I was just a little scared. So, when do we get started?''

``We can get started anytime. Did you bring the clothing we discussed?''

``Yes,'' she said opening her bag. She brought out four or five lingerie ensembles, the
nicest of which was a black bra and panty set with a sheer black robe. She even had a pair of
black heels to go with it. I told her that would be the one, and I left the room so she could
change.

While she changed, I filled the bucket with warm water and got the envelope with her
payment in it.

As she changed, Cass was checking out the room closely, as well as going over what she had
already learned through the conversation and her observations. She didn't have a good feeling
for this being the guy they were looking for, but that didn't mean a lot, really. She needed to
keep her eyes and ears open, especially as she was immobilized in the cast. Her earpiece
crackled a bit: ``Cass, since the conversation stopped, we assume you're alone at the moment.
Just wanted you to know we're still receiving you loud and clear.'' This reassured her, though
she really didn't think this was the rapist they were thinking he might be. She looked over the
cart by the table, and didn't see anything that looked remotely like a weapon or a restraint.
The room actually looked a lot like the emergency rooms that she'd been in as a patient or as an
investigating officer.

When I returned to the room, Samantha was standing by the table looking fantastic. I
handed her the envelope, and she looked inside briefly before placing it with her clothes, which
were folded neatly on the chair. I set the bucket on the cart, and told her to go ahead and have
a seat on the table. I took the roll of four inch stockinette, and asked her if she had a
preference as to which leg we put the cast on.

``I don't know- how about the left?'' she asked.

``That's fine with me,'' I said removing the shoe from her left foot and placing it with
her clothes.

I cut a four foot long piece of the stockinette from the roll, and slid it up her leg past
the knee. I took the scissors, and trimmed it a few inches past her toes. As I began wrapping
the four inch padding, she started asking me questions.

``So, how many times have you done this?''

``I've done this quite a bit, actually. I'd say I've probably worked with a dozen models,
or so. I've also worked with some of them more than once.''

``Have they all been in this area?'' She asked.

``Yes, they were all from around here. In fact, I think they were all students at the
university.''

This didn't fit with the theory Cass had, if he was telling the truth. That last question
had been a bit daring, so she decided to back down for the time being.

I finished with the padding, and tore open the roll of pink fiberglass. ``Sam, this gets a
bit warm as it sets, but it won't burn you. Just relax, and don't move your ankle until I tell
you it's okay.''

She nodded, and started asking questions again.

``So, what is the biggest cast you've ever put on a model? A body cast?''

``Yes,'' I said without looking up from the pink fiberglass I was wrapping her leg with.
``I've done three upper body casts so far.''

``How did the models like them?'' was the next question.

``Well, they didn't seem too bothered by them, but I don't think they would have wanted to
keep them on for long,'' I responded.

``I don't think they would either. I know I wouldn't. Have you ever had someone refuse to
do this? Has anyone ever freaked out on you?''

``I'm surprised that nobody has ever refused to do it. I would have expected more than one
of them to decide not to do it, once they learned what it was about, but everyone I've
interviewed has agreed. Well, I've interviewed a couple of potential models that weren't what we
were looking for, and I didn't even tell them what it was about. And nobody has 'freaked out' on
me, at least not yet.''

After I had finished wrapping the fiberglass, I peeled off my gloves and tossed them into
the trash. ``All done.'' I said. ``About 15 minutes for it to set, and we'll be ready to start
with the pictures. Would you like something to drink while we wait?''

``No, I'm fine.'' She said, thinking that she might have just avoided being drugged, and
waiting for his response to this.

``Okay, I'm going to get myself something.'' I said heading for the kitchen.

While he was gone, Cass was a bit nervous; waiting to see what would come from having
refused the offer for a drink. She hated having to be half naked, with her gun out of reach, and
her leg immobilized. In a very low voice she said ``Be alert guys, that drink I turned down may
have been where I was supposed to be drugged.'' Her earpiece instantly crackled again.

``We're ahead of you Cass. We already have two guys right in front of the house. Just say
the word, and we're inside.''

``Thanks.'' She said in the low voice, and waited for Quinn to return. The cast was
starting to get warm, but she'd been through this before.

When I returned to the room, Sam was still sitting where I'd left her.

``Doing alright?'' I asked, popping the top on my can of soda.

``Yes. It is starting to get pretty warm.'' I reassured her that this was normal, and
would go away in a few minutes. While we waited, I took my turn to ask her questions, mostly
about her schoolwork. As it turned out, she was studying psychology, which might have been why
she was asking so much about the other models, and their reactions. I felt a little vulnerable,
like maybe I was being analyzed. Still, we had a decent conversation.

After enough time had passed for the cast to set, I got the wheelchair, and helped her
into it.

``No crutches?'' she asked.

``No, at least not for now.'' I told her. ``The cast still isn't totally set, and won't be
for a little bit. We might get the crutches out in a little while, if you want to.''

I wheeled her into the living room, and helped her onto the couch, where I took several
pictures of her in varying poses. After these were done, enough time had passed for the cast to
be completely set, so I helped her to stand up. I took several more photos of her this way, and
when she placed her casted foot up on a small ottoman, I knew that was how I wanted to draw her.
I got my pad and pencils, and she quickly took form on the blank page. I was pleased with the
drawing, and when I was done, I showed it to her. She took the drawing and sat down in the
wheelchair and looked at it for a few moments.

``That is really good. It really looks like me.'' She said.

``Thanks. I try. If you're ready to get out of the cast, we're all done.''

She nodded, and I pushed her back to the casting room. She got up on the table. I took the
cast saw and followed the usual routine: cuts up both sides through the fiberglass, and up one
side through the padding and stockinette. When the cast was off, I set it aside, and left her to
change clothes.

While he was gone, Cass had several thoughts going through her head. This was almost over,
and this guy had done nothing wrong. She was a bit disappointed over not getting anything on the
guy, but relieved that things hadn't gotten dangerous. Still, she wasn't home free yet. She
couldn't let her guard down now.

When I returned to the room, she was dressed and ready. I thanked her, and asked if it was
too strange for her, or if she wanted to come back next week.

``I think I will come back, if I'm still welcome. What sort of cast will we be doing
then?''

``I honestly don't know, yet. I'll have to talk to the boss and see what he wants,'' I
told her. ``But, I can promise that he'll want something bigger, and maybe more than one cast. I
can call you after I talk to him, and you can decide whether or not you want to after we know
what he wants next.''

``That sounds good to me- you have my number.'' She said.

``Yes, I do, I'll call you before the weekend.'' I said. I opened the door for her, and
she walked to her car, not even giving so much as a glance to the survey crew which was right in
front of the house, now. The workers didn't make any comments to her this time, and she got in
her car and left. I went to clean up the casting room.

Back at the station, Cass went over the whole day with Johnson.  ``The guy was totally
professional. He didn't even touch me in any way remotely improper.'' Cass said. ``He didn't do
a thing wrong. I'll bet if I'd taken the drink from him that it would have been clean.'' Johnson
sighed a bit, and said ``I don't think this is the guy we're looking for. The perp in the other
cases always attacked on the first meeting. As far as we know, anyway. Still, I think that this
guy is worth looking at a bit longer, if you're up to it.''

Never wanting to show a bit of hesitation, Cass said ``Sure- you just want to see me end
up in a body cast, don't you?''

``Not really, I just have a feeling there's more to this guy than what you just saw.
Besides, he's not a complete angel- he just paid you money as an independent contractor in cash-
never took your social security number. He's already violated tax laws.''

``Wow, catching tax crooks- just what I always wanted to do!'' Cass said sarcastically.

``Yeah, it's right up your alley.'' Johnson said. ``I don't want to catch tax violators,
either. I just think there's more to this guy than what we've seen. Let's try it again next
week, Okay?''

``Sounds good to me.''
