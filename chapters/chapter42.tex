\begin{thought}
Monique woke several times during the night, wishing she could roll over and just move her
joints a bit. Each time, she could see that it was still dark outside, and she drifted back off
after a few minutes. Later, she woke to an itch just below her left knee. As her head cleared
slightly, she looked at the window, and from the light, knew it was still early. She struggled
to turn to see the clock: 6:32 a.m. Still early. She relaxed and willed herself not to think of
the itch. She drifted back to sleep.

She repeated the waking and drifting back to sleep a couple more times before she woke up
and realized that she was alone in the bed.

And she needed to pee. Badly.
\end{thought}

``Quinn!''

I was in the kitchen when she called. I went to her, and we took care of the need.
Afterward, I kissed her, and gave her a hug.

``Good morning. How did you sleep?''

``I woke up a lot, but I never stayed awake long. A few cramps here and there. Right now,
I'd give almost anything to just bring my knees up to my chest for a few seconds,'' she said.

``Give me about twenty minutes, and I can make that happen,'' I replied.

``I said ALMOST anything.'' She smiled. ``I wouldn't give that.''

``Alright,'' I replied. ``But you know you make the decisions, here. Only you know exactly how
you're feeling in there. If you need out, we get you out immediately.''

\begin{thought}
Horny. That's how I feel, Monique thought to herself. And we're going to have to do
something about it soon, too.
\end{thought}

``Alright, then. I'm deciding that I'd like to get out of the house. Even if it's just to the
backyard, I'd like to feel the sun on my face.''

``We can do that. Let's get you dressed and have some breakfast, then I want to make a quick
modification to the chair, then we can go out by the pool.''

I got the skirt and underwear she'd gotten to wear with the cast, along with a tank top that
she asked me to get. I helped her get dressed. The tank top she'd chosen was one that was pretty
tight on her without the cast, and now it clung very tightly. The top of the cast was clearly
defined through the taut fabric.

I wheeled her into the kitchen, where I'd cut up a cantaloupe and a couple of apples. We
ate these with bagels. Well, I did most of the eating, Monique didn't eat much before she
stopped, saying that she felt the cast getting tight around her stomach. I put up the leftovers,
and began my modifications to the wheelchair.

I got a tape measure, and measured the distance between her legs at the knees. I then went
out to the garage, and sawed off the two by four that I'd purchased the day before. I returned
to the house and retrieved two plastic covered pillows from the casting room. I then went back
to Monique and slid the board between her knees and the leg rests. I raised her legs slightly
and put the pillows between her legs and the board. Her weight would probably hold everything in
place, but as an extra measure, I secured the board to each leg rest with a short bungee cord.
With the change made, I took her outside.

We sat by the pool and talked for quite a while. We discussed our plans for getting her out
in public the next day. We talked about some of the plans for our trip to the mountains that
we'd decided on. I got the laptop, and we looked over a lot of the area attractions, but mostly
we looked at different trails to hike in the mountains.

And, of course, we talked about her cast. She talked about how comfortable it was. She
talked about the occasional muscle spasm she was having from the immobility, and assured me that
they were very tolerable. I reminded her how stunningly beautiful she looked in the cast.

We ate a light lunch out by the pool. Afterward, I suggested to Monique that we take a
drive.

``Going to slip in some early publicking?'' She asked.

``Not necessarily getting in any publicking,'' I answered. ``I'd just like to take a short run
today. I'd like to see how easy it is to get you in and out of the truck.''

She agreed and added ``It should be fun.''

I quickly cleaned up from lunch, inside and out, and then wheeled her to the Expedition. I
opened the door and moved the passenger's seat back as far as it would go, then reclined it to
what looked to be the proper angle. I then turned the wheelchair so that I could get to her from
the side. I picked her up, and I was slightly off balance. I stumbled one step, and for a brief
instant, I was sure I was going to drop her. She let out a surprised gasp.

``I'm sorry,'' I said after I'd regained my footing. ``This is a bit awkward.''

``That sounds like a nice way of telling me that I weigh a ton.'' She said playfully.

``No, your cast weighs a ton- your weight is fine,'' I reassured her.

I put her into the truck head first, laying her slightly sideways on the seat. I then
pushed her legs the rest of the way in. This would be a close fit. I hoped it would work. I
fastened her seat belt for her, then slowly closed the door. Her right foot wouldn't quite clear
the door with her sitting straight, but by turning her slightly to the left, there was enough
room to get the door closed.

I quickly disassembled the board and picked up the pillows that had fallen to the ground
when I picked her up. I put them in the back of the truck, then folded the wheelchair and put it
there as well.

When I got in the truck, I realized that it was hot inside. It looked as though her left
foot wasn't far enough over to interfere with me operating the accelerator pedal, though it was
close.

``Get some air conditioning going!'' she said. ``Don't forget that these concrete jeans get
warm fast!'' She added with a smile.

As we drove along, I noticed a couple of problems with transporting her in this position.
First was the loading. I could handle lifting her in and (I assumed) out of the truck, but it
was difficult. My mind began pondering something to make this easier. The other was the issue of
restraint. The seat belt fit fine over her, but so reclined, in an accident, she would slide out
from underneath, and would likely slide under the air bag, as well. I was pondering solutions to
these issues when she spoke:

You're a million miles away. Care to share what you're thinking?'' She asked.

\begin{thought}
As he explained, realizing his level of concern was comforting to Monique. Just knowing
that he tried to think of everything, and was always thinking of her- her comfort, her safety,
her enjoyment of everything they did. This was certainly a different type of man than any she
had known, except for her father.
\end{thought}

We spent about an hour driving around. The ride didn't provide any discomfort to Monique. I
had concerns about not being able to see out of the vehicle possibly causing carsickness, but we
were lucky in that respect. Of course, tomorrow's drive would be closer to three hours one way.
I'd be sure to pack some Dramamine, just in case.

Back home, I set up the wheelchair and lifted her out of the truck and back into it. I
wheeled her back in the house and to the hospital bed on the first floor. Lifting her out of the
truck was a bit of a struggle, but I managed. And I had my idea for making this easy pretty well
finalized.

We weren't quite hungry for dinner yet, so I decided it was time to do another sketch of my
casted beauty. I excused myself to get my supplies.

\begin{thought}
Lying on the bed, waiting for Quinn to get back with his pencils and paper, Monique was a
lady with a plan: Her thoughts during the drive about how caring Quinn was had her mind stirred
up. The plaster shell holding her so immobile had her body whipped into a frenzy. She wanted
Quinn, and she wanted him soon. She knew he had to be feeling similarly, but was waiting to make
sure she was ready to try things with this cast. To help his mind along the way, she undid the
Velcro holding her skirt closed at the side, and struggled until she'd managed to pull it out
from under herself.
\end{thought}

When I walked back into the room, I was greeted by being hit in the face with some sort of
cloth. Catching it and looking at it, I recognized it as Monique's skirt. She was looking up at
me with the sweet, playful smile of a girl, but the seductive look in her eyes was all woman.

I smiled at her. I knew what was on her mind, and she knew that I knew. No words were
needed. I kissed her before I sat down and began drawing.

When I was finished, I set my pencils and paper down and moved over to kiss her. She
stopped me before I could.

``Hey, I want to see that,'' she said, pointing to the paper.

Looking at it, she said ``Damn, you're good.''

Looking into her eyes, I said ``Damn, you're beautiful,'' and began kissing her. She stopped
me after a few moments.

``What are the chances of spending the evening in bed? OUR bed,'' she said with a smile. ``I
don't know how or if you can get me upstairs, but this cast has been turning me on for over 24
hours, and I really need you soon. I need US soon.''

I thought for a minute. There was no chance of getting her upstairs in the wheelchair. As
wide as her feet were apart, there's no way we'd make it past the turn in the staircase, and
that was even if she'd fit up to that point. I'd have to carry her, and I was pretty sure I knew
how to do it.

I smiled at her. ``Well, when you're all immobilized, I am always at your beck and call, and
that is my favorite of all your becks and calls.''

I wheeled her inside to the bottom of the staircase. The skirt would have to go in order
for me to get her upstairs, so I took it off of her, and then told her of my idea. She agreed
and I lowered the leg rests and picked her up into a standing position. It was a bit of a risk,
as we couldn't be sure that the cast was dry enough yet. Fortunately, we didn't damage it. I
picked her up by squatting slightly, wrapping my arms around her and grabbing the ends of the
spreader bar, then standing back up. She was certainly heavy, but I could manage her like this.
Carrying her this way put no strain on my back, and this was certainly NO time to pull a back
muscle!

I slowly went upstairs, one step at a time. Her breasts were in my face as we went. I was
already quite worked up myself, and this only increased my desire for her. She joked with me a
bit. ``Sir, are you staring at my chest?''

By the time I laid her down on our bed, my thigh muscles were aching, as well as my hands.
I joined her on the bed, and she pulled me into a passionate kiss.

From there, things only got more and more heated. I pulled the tank top off of her, and
then untied the underwear and gave them a toss across the room. I began exploring all of the
openings of her cast with my hands and then my mouth. The moans and sighs let me know that this
gorgeous casted lady was enjoying herself as much as I was. I didn't care that the angle that
her hips were casted at would prevent normal lovemaking- I love pleasuring her, and watching her
squirm against the confines of her cast, listening to the sounds she makes is an enjoyment that
can't quite be described.

\begin{thought}
As Quinn slowly explored the parts of her body that were accessible, the restrictions of
the cast only intensified Monique's desire. Making love while casted has been a wonderful
experience in the past. It wasn't that it was better to her, she equally loved being with Quinn
while completely mobile. But, it was different when she was casted, and it was special in its'
own way. Each way had its' own special place, and she loved it both ways. And the position that
this cast held her legs and hips was very sensual and exciting to her in itself.

As the orgasm rocked her, being unable to move her legs and hips seemed only to make it
last longer. Of course, the fact that Quinn didn't stop certainly helped, too. But, she couldn't
stand being the only one. She stopped him, telling him that she wanted to take care of him, too.

She motioned for him to stand up, and she undid his belt and the button on his jeans. He
had to finish stripping, and when he had lay back beside her, she used her arms to scoot toward
the foot of the bed.
\end{thought}

At this point, I made a decision in my mind. I certainly wasn't going to deny her, but I
wasn't done with her, either. I turned around on the bed, and I reached over and turned her
over, pulling her on top of me. The weight of the stomach portion of her cast was heavy on my
chest, but I found that I could put my elbows on the bed, and support some of the weight with my
hands. She supported some of the weight with her elbows, leaving her hands free, and soon we
were enjoying both the pleasure that we were giving and receiving.

I don't know how long we spent ``sending each other to the stars,'' as we sometimes called
it, nor do I remember how many times we did. I do know that we were both very spent and
satisfied and that I turned back around and held her, and we fell asleep in each other's arms.
Dinner was forgotten I don't know if it was the exhausting day we'd had on Friday, fitful sleep
on Friday night, or what we'd just done, but we both slept soundly through until Sunday
morning.
